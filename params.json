The data can either be the distinct values, \r\ncategorized, or even generated by an own function (that takes the objects value as an argument).\r\n\r\nThey are interactive with the other widgets, so a selection/highlight of a pie chart slice will \r\nselect/highlight those objects in the other widgets. And a selection/highlight in another widget\r\nwill reduce the piechart to those selected/highlighted values.\r\n\r\n### Fuzzy Timeline\r\n\r\nIf the dataset has uncertain time-data (as with historical/archaeological data) this uncertainity \r\nshould be shown and represented in the time-plot. The fuzzy timeline will add an object in such a\r\nway, that its weight is equaly spread across the timespan that is attached to it.\r\n\r\nAlso it is possible to switch to a bar-chart representation of the data. With bar-intervals of e.g.\r\n1,10,100,... years.\r\n\r\n### Directed Line-Overlay\r\n\r\nWith this widget it is possibile to add \"lines\" (optionally arrows) between objects on the map.\r\n\r\nIf objects are clustered the links will be inherited and line thickness will be increased if\r\nlines are doubled by this clustering.\r\n\r\n### Dataset coloring on element (DataObject) basis\r\n\r\nEach DataObject can have an own color, if objects are clustered together, the cluster color \r\nis calculated as the average of the RGB values.\r\n\r\n### Story-Telling\r\n\r\n(This feature is unstable and under heavy development.)\r\n\r\nAs this tool also has an focus on data-analysis, it can be interesting to\r\n* record the steps of selection/piechart creation/dataset refining\r\n* go back a step or more in this history of data transformation\r\n* branch this history\r\n* save this history\r\n* send this history to other persons\r\n* create a presentation, or animation, of that history","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
