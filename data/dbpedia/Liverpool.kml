Born in Wrexham, he began his career with his hometown club, making his debut during the 1990/91 season. He showed much potential, which in March 1992, earned him a move to Liverpool, aged 18. He failed to break into Liverpool's first team though, and made just four appearances in 5 years, due in part to suffering two broken legs.</description>

He played the peak of his career for Sunderland, in a famous period of time in the club's history where they were dubbed the 'team of all talents'. Noted for his exceptional performances in goal, he was also famously shy of his bald head, and always wore a cap. If during a football game the cap blew off at any point, he would chase after it rather than concentrate on the game.</description>
