            <description>Paul McGrath (born 4 December 1959) is a retired Irish footballer, who played as a central defender. In a career greatly hampered by physical and off-the-field problems, he played 14 professional seasons with Aston Villa and Manchester United (seven apiece). The vast majority of his career league appearances were made in the claret and blue of Aston Villa, however. A tough tackler, he often defied medical knowledge, due to the conditioning of his knees.</description>
