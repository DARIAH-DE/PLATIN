The site was designed by Alfred Messel and Ludwig Hoffmann and was constructed in twenty years, from 1910 to 1930. The Pergamon houses original-sized, reconstructed monumental buildings such as the Pergamon Altar, the Market Gate of Miletus, all consisting of parts transported from Turkey. There is controversy over the legitimacy of the acquisition of the collection. It was suggested that the collection should be returned to Turkey (original country of the excavations). The museum is subdivided into the antiquity collection, the Middle East museum, and the museum of Islamic art. The museum is visited by approximately 850,000 people every year, making it the most visited art museum in Germany (2006).</description>

The building, which is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was reconstructed in the 1930s from the architectural elements of several European medieval abbeys. It is used to exhibit art and architecture from Medieval Europe. The Cloisters, which is near the northern tip of Manhattan island on a hill overlooking the Hudson River, incorporates parts from five French cloistered abbeys. Buildings at Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa, Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, Bonnefont-en-Comminges, Trie-en-Bigorre, and Froville were all disassembled brick-by-brick before being shipped to New York. Between 1934 and 1938, the features were reassembled in Fort Tryon Park. The area around The Cloisters was landscaped with gardens planted according to horticultural information obtained from medieval manuscripts and artefacts.</description>

            <description>The Frick Collection is an art museum located in Manhattan, New York City, United States. It is housed in the former Henry Clay Frick House, which was designed by Thomas Hastings and constructed in 1913-1914. The Frick was built at a time when almost every building on Fifth Avenue above 59th Street was a private mansion, with a few private clubs and a hotel. Amidst this wealth, Henry Clay Frick's home was among the most opulent, with private gardens both on the avenue front and in an interior courtyard. The house is worth visiting independent of the collection. The Frick is one of the preeminent small art museums in the United States, with a very high-quality collection of old master paintings and fine furniture housed in 16 galleries within the formerly occupied residential mansion. The paintings in many galleries are still arranged according to Frick's design, although additional works have been bought by the Frick Collection over the years in a manner deemed to correspond with the aesthetic of the collection. The collection features some of the best-known paintings by major European artists, as well as numerous works of sculpture and porcelain. It also has 18th century French furniture, Limoges enamel, and Oriental rugs. After Frick's death, his daughter, Helen Clay Frick, expanded the collection, with a third of its art works acquired since 1919. The Frick also oversees the Frick Art Reference Library.</description>

It is one of the oldest and largest planetariums in the United States having welcomed over 7 million visitors by its 60th anniversary in 2009. As a unit of the university, Morehead receives about one-third of its funding through state sources, one-third through ticket and gift sales, and one-third through gifts and grants. First opened in 1949, the planetarium was used to train Gemini and Apollo program astronauts in celestial navigation. Until the late 1990s, it contained one of the largest working Copernican orreries in the world. The facility was donated to the university by alumnus John Motley Morehead III who invested over $3 million in the facility.</description>

            <description>Fort Henry (also known as Fort Henry National Historic Site) is located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada on Point Henry, a strategic point located near the mouth of the Cataraqui River where it flows into the St. Lawrence River, at the upper end of the Thousand Islands. The original fort was constructed during the War of 1812, when present-day Ontario was a British colony known as Upper Canada. The British anticipated the possibility of a United States attack on Point Henry due to its proximity to the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyards (the site of the present-day Royal Military College of Canada). The loss of this vital shipping route would have cut off supplies to Kingston and the rest of Upper Canada.</description>

            <description>Fort George National Historic Site is a historic military structure at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, that was the scene of several battles during the War of 1812. The fort consists of earthworks and palisades, along with internal structures, including an officer's quarters, blockhouses to accommodate other ranks and their families, and a stone powder magazine, which is the only original building on the site. Opposite the fort, across the Niagara River, stands Fort Niagara in New York, which can be seen from Fort George's ramparts. Fort George was built by the British Army after Jay's Treaty (1796) required Britain to withdraw from Fort Niagara. The new fort was completed in 1802 and became the headquarters for the British Army and the local militia. Fort George was captured by U.S. forces in May 1813 at the Battle of Fort George. The American Army used the fort as a base to invade Upper Canada, but were repelled at the Battles of Stoney Creek and Beaver Dams. The fort was recaptured by the British Army in December. The fortification was used by the Canadian Army as a military training base during the First World War and through the Second World War under the name Camp Niagara. The grounds were eventually abandoned by the military in 1965. The site is now a National Historic Site, maintained by Parks Canada. The fort is open to visitors from April to October. The staff maintains the image of the fort as it was during the early 19th century, with period costumes, exhibits, and displays of that time. They train summer students in the infantry tactics and firing drills of the 41 regiment from the War of 1812. They also have the 41 Fife and Drum Corps which provides an example of how the fife and drums were used.</description>

            <description>Imperial War Museum North (sometimes referred to as IWM North) is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester, England. One of the five branches of the Imperial War Museum, the museum explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal in Trafford Park, an area which during the Second World War was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays. The museum building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture, but has also been criticised for poor energy efficiency. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum. As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free.</description>

            <description>The Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (CMCP) was a gallery of Canada's best art and documentary photography. Founded in 1985 and affiliated to the National Gallery of Canada, it is located at 380 Sussex Drive, Ottawa. The roots of the collection reach back to the 1939 Stills Photography Division of the National Film Board of Canada and it did not have a permanent home until it moved to its present location. The building, which was opened on May 7, 1992, was designed by architect Michael Lundhom, who adapted an old railway tunnel running alongside the Chateau Laurier. The glass and concrete entrance from the street, reminiscent of the colonnade leading into the National Gallery, leads patrons down to the main part of the museum which is located below street level. As of March 29, 2009 it was announced that the CMCP, which had been closed temporarily in 2006 due to a leak, will be permanently closed. Its collections and program of exhibition has been absorbed by the National Gallery of Canada. A campaign to maintain the CMCP is underway with the hope of maintaining the museum in its purpose-built site.</description>

            <description>The Seagram Museum in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada was the city's final operational remnant of the world-renowned distillery founded by Waterloo entrepreneur Joseph E. Seagram in the mid-19th century. The museum operated from May 1984 to March 1997. Designed by architect Barton Myers, it was built at a cost of $4.75 million and its entrance was a renovated late-19th century rack warehouse from the Seagram plant. It had a variety of exhibits illustrating everyday life in the liquor distillery in the late 19th and early 20th century. Seagram closed its Waterloo plant in 1992, and the museum continued to operate for another five years. It narrowly escaped a fire in 1993 that destroyed the building next to it. The City of Waterloo purchased the Seagram property for $4 million in the fall of 1997. The museum donated its archives to the University of Waterloo. Two former barrelhouses on the site were converted into condominiums while the museum became an office building, leased to software company Waterloo Maple. The company moved into the renovated building in June 1998. In July 2002, the city sold the building to the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) for $2.5 million. In September 2003, Waterloo Maple left the building and CIGI moved in. As of 2006 it also houses the Canada's Technology Triangle and the Project Ploughshares. The building is located at 57 Erb Street West in Waterloo.</description>

            <description>Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens is a municipal museum in Sunderland, England. It is part of the Tyne and Wear Museums group, and is sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It contains the only known British example of a gliding reptile, the oldest known vertebrate capable of gliding flight. The exhibit was discovered in Eppleton quarry. It was established in 1846 in the Athenaeum Building in Fawcett Street, the first municipally funded museum in the country outside of London. In 1879 the Museum moved to a new larger building next to Mowbray Park including a library and winter garden based on the model of the Crystal Palace. President Ulysses Grant was in attendance at the laying of the foundation stone by Alderman Samuel Storey in 1877. The building was opened in 1879. The Winter Garden was damaged by a parachute mine in 1941 and was demolished with a 1960s extension taking its place, but in 2001 a lottery funded refurbishment of the Museum created a new Winter Garden extension and improved facilities. In 2003 the Museum was recognised as the most attended outside London. The Museum contains a large collection of the locally made Sunderland Lustreware pottery. Other highlights of the Museum are a stuffed Lion, the remains of a Walrus brought back from Siberia in the 1880s and the first Nissan car to be made in Sunderland. Also featured are the skeletal remains of a male human being. The library was moved in 1995 to the new City Library and Arts Centre in Fawcett Street (occupying part of the former Binns Department Store). The move left more space for museum exhibits. The new City Library Arts Centre also houses the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art, renowned as one of the leading forums for new artists in the North of England. L.S. Lowry described his discovery of Sunderland in 1960, after which it became his second home: ‘One day I was travelling south from Tyneside and I realised this was what I had always been looking for. ’ Sunderland Museum, with six works and 30 on long-term loan, have a collection surpassed only by Salford and Manchester.</description>

The museum is part of the wider network of Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales (formerly the National Museums and Galleries of Wales). Entry is kept free by a grant from the Welsh Assembly Government. The National Museum of Wales was founded in 1907, when it inherited the collection of the Cardiff Museum, which shared the building of Cardiff Central Library. Construction of a new building in the civic complex of Cathays Park began in 1912, but owing to the First World War it did not open to the public until 1927. The architects were Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Brewer, although the building as it now stands is a heavily truncated version of their design. The museum has collections of archaeology, botany, fine and applied art, geology and zoology.</description>

            <description>The Museum of Glass (MOG) is a museum dedicated to the medium of glass art located in Tacoma, Washington. It is not to be confused with the various other Museums of Glass, such as the one in Corning, New York, as the museum focuses on Contemporary and Pacific Northwest glass-art. The Tacoma area was selected in part because it is the hometown of noted glass artist Dale Chihuly. The museum, the brainchild of Dr. Philip M. Phibbs, was designed by acclaimed Canadian architect Arthur Erickson and opened in July 2002. It is located on the Thea Foss Waterway and near the University of Washington Tacoma in downtown. The museum is linked to the downtown area via Bridge of Glass. The bridge consists of thousands of glass-art masterpieces created by Chihuly to make up the Venetian Wall, Seaform Pavilion and Crystal Towers. The museum exhibits a conical building, which houses the glass blowing demonstrations. The room reaches 90 feet (27 m) and has two furnaces reaching temperatures of 2,400 °F (1,320 °C). There were also several other outdoor exhibits including the Water Forest (which was restored in summer 2009), reflecting pools and a waterfront promenade.</description>

            <description>Battleship Cove, located in Fall River, Massachusetts, is a nonprofit maritime museum and war memorial that traces its origins to the wartime crew of the World War II battleship USS Massachusetts. This dedicated veterans group was responsible for the donation of the decommissioned vessel from the Navy and its subsequent public display in Fall River, Massachusetts. Formally registered as the U.S.S. Massachusetts Memorial Committee, Inc. , Battleship Cove was incorporated as a nonprofit educational organization and granted 501 c(3) status by the Internal Revenue Service in 1964. The site is located at the confluence of the Taunton River and Mount Hope Bay, an arm of Narragansett Bay. Battleship Cove lies partially beneath the Braga Bridge and adjacent to Fall River Heritage State Park, at the heart of Fall River's waterfront. The battleship forms a small cove which serves as a protected harbor for pleasure craft during the summer months. The Fall River Yacht Club maintains a dock nearby. The site also contains the historic 1920 Lincoln Park Carousel, originally located at Lincoln Park in nearby North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, restored by local vocational high school students and installed in a new pavilion in the early 1990s.</description>

            <address>Canon's Wharf, Bristol, England</address>
            <description>At-Bristol is a public science and technology &quot;exploration&quot; and education centre and charity in Bristol, England. As a visitor attraction, At-Bristol has over 300 hands-on exhibits, and a Planetarium with seasonal shows for the over fives, and a 'Little Stars' show for children aged five and under. In addition to trails and activities, they also have changing exhibitions and presenter-led Live Science shows. They have recently started holding special events for under sixes called 'Toddler Takeover'. At-Bristol also welcome 40,000 school pupils every, from pre-school to post-16, for school visits and education workshops. They are also host to the Science Learning Centre South West, and together they offer continuing professional development for teachers and other science communicators. There are rooms and roof terraces above the exhibition that At-Bristol offers for venue hire, and these have been used for events such as the Sky News media hub for the General Election Debate, as well as other conferences, meetings and events. These spaces are also available for weddings and civil partnerships. At-Bristol also hires out the exhibition floor, Planetarium, Millenium Square and Anchor. Although they are a separate organisation to Blue Reef Aquarium, they manage their venue hire spaces. Another interesting fact is that At-Bristol has it's own exhibition workshop on site. This has allowed them to develop an 'Exhibition Services' arm, where they provide exhibitions and/or exhibits for sale or hire, for other science centres, museums and visitor attractions. At-Bristol also fundraises to run projects, to allow them to do outreach work, taking science out to groups who can't visit At-Bristol. That includes a variety of groups, from low-income schools to hospitals. At its opening the centre consisted of Explore, which contains features on mechanics, sound and light, computer science, space and the human brain; Wildwalk, a science centre comprising two artificial rainforests, aquariums and other ecology-related exhibits; and an IMAX theatre. Wildwalk and the IMAX Theatre closed at the end of March 2007 due to a lack of funding and government support. Explore rebranded to At-Bristol in June 2010, and continues to operate, and the Wildwalk building has been converted into an aquarium by Blue Reef Aquarium, with the IMAX cinema being used to show nature and wildlife films.</description>

            <description>Scienceworks is a science museum in Melbourne, Australia. It is a venue of Museum Victoria which administers the cultural and scientific collections of the State of Victoria. It is located in the suburb of Spotswood. Opened in March 1992, Scienceworks is housed in a purpose-built building &quot;styled along industrial lines&quot; near the historic Spotswood Pumping Station, constructed in 1897, whose steam engines form an associated exhibit. Displays and activities offered by the museum include hands-on experiments, demonstrations, and tours. The &quot;lightning room&quot; is a 120-seat auditorium that presents demonstrations about electricity, featuring a giant Tesla Coil, capable of generating two million volts of electricity, producing three metre lightning bolts. The museum also has the only digital planetarium in the southern hemisphere. The 1883 clock tower from Flinders Street Station is also located at the museum. The clock had been moved to Princes Bridge Station in 1905 and Spencer Street Station in 1911, where it remained sold into private ownership after the station redevelopment of 1967.</description>

            <address>Murney Point, Kingston, Ontario, Canada</address>
            <description>Murney Tower is a Martello tower in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, whose construction dates to 1846 and the Oregon crisis. Officially designated as Murray Tower, the locals called it Murney Tower, as it was built on Murney Point, which was owned by the Murney family at the time. They have since relocated to the Cobourgh area. Eventually the name was changed to coincide with local usage. Its builders intended that Murney (then Murray) Tower complement the fortifications of Fort Henry, Ontario. Cathcart Tower on Cedar Island, Shoal Tower in the Confederation Basin and Fort Frederick on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada were part of the same strategic improvements. The tower stands surrounded by a dry ditch and is accessible only by bridge. Murney's walls are about 3 metres thick on the land side and up to 5 metres thick on the lakeside. The main floor (ground level) was the barracks level and has two 32-lb caronade cannons pointed out shuttered windows. The lower floors were the magazine and storage and gun turrets to shoot at anyone inside the ditch. The top floor is the gun platform with one large cannon that can be rotated along an iron rail. A 'rapid removal' roof was later added to protect the gun and keep out the large amounts of snow that did not figure into the mediterranean design of the tower. This is a common feature on Canadian Martellos. Martello towers were, however, already becoming obsolete by the time of construction and militarily worthless within 20 years; it never saw action. By the mid-to-late 19th century the tower was used as a familial barracks for an officer with many children. After the turn of the century, this was discontinued and for a time there were no definite plans for the tower. One of them included the idea of cutting the top off the tower and placing a large statue of Sir John A. MacDonald atop. In 1921 a windstorm blew off the original wooden roof and thus the current roof does not allow for rapid removal in case of attack. Murney Tower is a National Historic Site, managed and maintained by the Kingston Historical Society, who operates it as a military museum during the summer months (May - End of August). Displays include cannons (32-lbs), uniforms, Lee Enfields, and other mid 19th century military artifacts. Although 16 Martello towers were built in Canada, only 11 are still standing, four of them in Kingston. Two of these towers, Murney Tower and Fort Frederick are open to the public and contain museums. Fort Frederick houses the Royal Military College of Canada Museum. The tower is part of the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications World Heritage Site.</description>

Powell Hall's permanent public exhibits focus on the flora, fauna, fossils and historic peoples of the state Florida. The museum does not charge for admission to most exhibits; the exceptions are the Butterfly Rainforest and certain traveling exhibits. The museum was founded in 1891 and relocated to the campus of the University of Florida in 1906 and was chartered as the state's official natural history museum by the Florida Legislature in 1917. Formerly known as the Florida State Museum, the name was changed in 1988 to more accurately reflect the museum's mission and help avoid confusion with Florida State University, which is located in Tallahassee.</description>

It is planned that there will eventually be an industrial demonstration railway line running around the perimeter of the MRT/Apedale Heritage Centre site, connecting with a recreation of an adit called No 7 Drift (from which coal was extracted by the previous occupiers of the site, the Aurora Mining Company, until around 1996).</description>

            <description>The Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire or IFAN Museum of African Arts in Dakar, Senegal is one of the oldest art museums in West Africa. It was promoted by Léopold Senghor, the country's first President. In December 2007, its official title was changed to The Théodore Monod African Art Museum (&quot;Musée Théodore Monod d'Art africain&quot;), after the French naturalist Théodore André Monod, former director of IFAN. Previously its official name had been &quot;Le Musée d'Art africain de l'Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire Cheikh Anta Diop IFAN/CAD&quot;. The museum is part of the Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN) institute, founded 1936 under the Popular Front government in France. When IFAN was transferred to Cheikh Anta Diop University in 1960, the building at Place Soweto near the National Assembly of Senegal was converted into a museum. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture, and part of the Cheikh Anta Diop University. As the main cultural research center of the colonies of French West Africa, it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa. The museum is one of the regular venues used in the Dakar Biennale exhibition, showing art by contemporary African and diaspora artists.

            <address>Petersburg, Kentucky, United States</address>
            <description>The Creation Museum is a museum that presents an account of the origins of the universe, life, mankind, and man's early history according to a literal reading of the Book of Genesis. This museum has been heavily criticized by the scientific and academic communities as promoting &quot;fallacy over fact&quot; and attempting to advance the tenets of a particular religion while rejecting scientific knowledge. Its exhibits reject universal common descent, along with most other central tenets of evolution, and assert that the Earth and all of its life forms were created 6000 years ago over a six-day period. In contrast to the overwhelming scientific consensus, exhibits promote young Earth creationist claims, including the idea that humans and dinosaurs once coexisted, and that dinosaurs were on Noah's Ark. The museum exhibits are at odds with the determination of the scientific community that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, and that the dinosaurs became extinct 65.5 million years before human beings arose. The museum has generated criticism by the scientific community, several groups of educators, Christian groups opposed to young Earth creationism, and in the general press. The museum, which is said to have cost $27 million, is privately funded through donations to the apologetics ministry Answers in Genesis and opened its doors to the public on May 28, 2007. Based on projections, the museum anticipated 250,000 paying visitors in its first year of operation. According to AiG, within its first two months attendance surpassed 100,000 visitors by July 21, 2007 and 200,000 visitors on September 20, 2007. They claim that visitor attendance also exceeded first year expectations only 5 months and 5 days after opening, with a total of 250,000 visitors on November 2, 2007, and the half-million visitor mark was reached just under 9 months later. The one-millionth visitor was announced on April 26, 2010, just over a month away from the museum's three-year anniversary.</description>

            <name>Central State Hospital (Indiana)</name>
            <address>Indianapolis, Indiana</address>
            <description>Central State Hospital, formally referred to as the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane was a psychiatric treatment hospital in Indiana. While the Indiana legislature had authorized the establishment of a &quot;hospital for the insane&quot; as early as 1827, the doors of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane (later re-named Central State Hospital) did not open until November, 1848. At this time, the hospital (called the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane after 1889 and then called Central State Hospital after 1926) opened with five patients and a single building, and by 1928, physicians cared for nearly 3,000 patients. At that time, the hospital consisted of one brick building situated on a large parcel of land, numbering over 100 acres (0.40 km), in the outskirts of Indianapolis (on Washington Street, west of downtown). From 1848-1948, the hospital grew yearly until it encompassed two massive ornate buildings for the male and female patients, a pathological department, a &quot;sick&quot; hospital for the treatment of physical ailments, a farm colony where patients engaged in &quot;occupational therapy&quot;, a chapel, an amusement hall complete with an auditorium, billiards, and bowling alleys, a bakery, a fire house, a cannery manned by patients, and idyllic gardens and fountains. The more ornate of the two massive ornate buildings came to be known as &quot;the Seven Steeples&quot;. This building was designed using the Kirkbride plan for mental healthcare facilities. For a half-century, this complex array of buildings and gardens beckoned to all of the state's mentally ill. By 1905, however, mental health institutions elsewhere in Indiana, built in Evansville, Logansport, Madison, and Richmond relieved an overcrowded Central State Hospital of some of its patient load, leaving it to treat only those from the &quot;central district&quot;, an area of 38 counties situated in the middle portion of the state. In 1950 patient population reached 2,500 By the early 1970s, most of the hospital's ostentatious, Victorian-era buildings were declared unsound and razed. The Men's Department Building (a Kirkbride) had been demolished in 1941. In their place, the state constructed brick buildings of a nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings and the medical staff therein continued to serve the state's mentally ill, until allegations of patient abuse and funding troubles sparked an effort to forge new alternatives to institutionalization which, in turn, led to the hospital's closure in 1994.</description>

            <description>The New Museum, founded in 1977 by Marcia Tucker, is the only museum in New York City exclusively devoted to presenting contemporary art from around the world. Over the past five years, the New Museum has exhibited artists from Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Germany, Poland, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom among many other countries. The Museum presents the work of under-recognized artists, and has mounted ambitious surveys of important figures such as Ana Mendieta, William Kentridge, David Wojnarowicz, Paul McCarthy and Andrea Zittel before they received widespread public recognition. In 2003 the New Museum presented the highly-regarded exhibition Black President: The Art and Legacy of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti. Also in 2003, the New Museum formed an affiliation with Rhizome, a leading online platform for global new media art. In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In December 2007, the New Museum opened the doors to its new location on 235 Bowery, at Prince Street. This new facility, designed by the Tokyo-based firm Sejima + Nishizawa/SANAA and the New York-based firm Gensler, has greatly expanded the Museum’s exhibitions and space. In March 2008, the museum's new building was named one of the architectural seven wonders by Conde Nast Traveler.</description>

            <description>The Studio Museum in Harlem is an American contemporary art museum in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, New York. It was founded in 1968 as the first such museum in the U.S. devoted in the art of African-Americans, specializing in 19th and 20th century work as well work of artists of African descent. It is located on 125th Street, between Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Blvd. and Lenox Avenue. The scope of the Studio Museum includes exhibitions, Artists-in-Residence program, education and public programming, a permanent collection, and archival and research facilities. Since opening in a rented loft at Fifth Avenue and 125th Street in 1968, the Studio Museum has earned recognition for its catalytic role in promoting the works of artists of African descent. The Museum's Artists-in-Residence program has supported over ninety graduates who have gone on to highly regarded careers. A wide variety of education and public programs have brought the African-American experience alive for the public by means of lectures, dialogues, panel discussions and performances, as well as interpretive programs, both on- and off-site, for students and teachers. The exhibitions program has also expanded the scope of art historical literature through the production of scholarly catalogues, brochures and pamphlets. Collection The Studio Museum's permanent collection contains over 1,600 works, including drawings, pastels, prints, photographs, mixed-media works and installations. It comprises works created by artists during their residencies, as well as pieces given to the Museum to create an art-historical framework for artists of African descent. Featured in the collection is Terry Adkins, Romare Bearden, Skunder Boghossian, Robert Colescott, Melvin Edwards, Richard Hunt, Hector Hyppolite, Serge Jolimeau, Lois Mailou Jones, Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis, Philome Obin, Betye Saar, Nari Ward and Hale Woodruff, among others. The Museum also is the custodian of an extensive archive of the work of photographer James VanDerZee, the quintessential chronicler of the Harlem community from 1906 to 1983. History Founded in 1968, in a rented loft located at Fifth Avenue and 125th Streets, The Studio Museum in Harlem has supported some of the most influential American artist. The basic principle leading to its establishment was simple: to create an uptown space focused on contemporary experimental art. After two years of preparation, the museum celebrated the opening of its first exhibition, Electronic Reflections II, featuring works by artist Tom Lloyd, in September 1968. Originally, the museum focused on workshops and exhibition programs that were designed to give artists a space to practice their craft, create works and show them. This idea led the trustees of the museum to start an Artist-in-Residence program. The Artist-in-Residence program will celebrate its 40th year in 2010. It has helped to cultivate the art making practices and careers of more than one hundred artists.</description>

It is located in the Chelsea district of central London, England adjacent to the Royal Hospital Chelsea, the home of the &quot;Chelsea Pensioners&quot;. The National Army Museum is open to the public every day of the year from 10.00am to 5.30pm, except on 24 - 26 December and 1 January. Admission is free. The museum is a non-departmental public body. There are many museums in the United Kingdom which cover aspects of British Army history, in particular, Regimental museums can be found all over the country. Two well-known army related museums in London are the Imperial War Museum, which focuses on 20th century warfare, including World War I and World War II, and Firepower – The Royal Artillery Museum. However the National Army Museum is designed to tell the overall story of the Army as a whole, explore the lives of those who served with the British Army from both Britain and elsewhere, and explain the impact the British Army has had on shaping the history of Great Britain, Europe and the rest of the world. It also examines the history of the British Army through the ages, from the time of the Norman Conquest to the early 21st century, and the conflicts of today.</description>

            <description>The Vancouver Maritime Museum is a Maritime museum devoted to presenting the maritime history of Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Canadian Arctic. About to celebrate its 50th year of operating, it is located within Vanier Park just west of False Creek on the Vancouver waterfront. The main exhibit is the St. Roch, an historic arctic exploration vessel used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The museum also has extensive galleries of model ships, including one with historic model ships built entirely from cardboard or paper as well as a particularly fine bone model of the French warship &quot;Vengeur de Peuple which was built around 1800 by French prisoners of war, a Children's Maritime Discovery Centre, a recreation of the forecastle of Vancouver's ship &quot;Discovery&quot;, an extensive collection of maritime art, and a large library and archives. It displays outside the NASA undersea research vessel &quot;Ben Franklin&quot; and the boiler of the &quot;Beaver&quot;, the first steamship in the Pacific NW; it also has a small heritage harbour. There is a workshop where visitors can watch craftsmen build models. Of particular significance is the extensive Chung collection of material relating to Canadian Pacific Steamships and original hand drawn charts from Captain Cook's exploration of the Pacific. The St. Roch is enclosed in an A-frame, which, unfortunately, has not proven to be the ideal structure for her preservation or display. The St. Roch needs some conservation work and her protective structure needs to be replaced with a larger structure with better climate control.</description>

            <description>Wonder Works is a children's museum, a non-profit corporation established in 2002, located in the village of Oak Park, Illinois. It is the successor to the Children's Museum of Oak Park, established in 1993. The museum is dedicated to the principle of offering a fun, largely self-directed playing and learning place for children. Occupying its own building in one of the village's business districts, the museum attracted fifty thousand visitors in 2004. They enjoyed the facilities as drop-in visitors, as museum members, as birthday party invitees, or as special-event attendees. The museum funds its operations by means of the sale of visitor day passes, yearly memberships, proceeds from special events, proceeds from toy-store sales, and direct grants. Special events generally include subscription-based concerts and the rental of a dedicated party room. In 2004 the museum was financially self-sufficient for operations. It is managed by a board of directors comprising members of the local community; an executive director; an operations floor manager; a program manager; and a number of full-, part-time, or volunteer floor assistants.</description>

            <description>The 1932 &amp;amp; 1980 Lake Placid Winter Olympic Museum, sometimes referred to as the Lake Placid Winter Olympic Museum, in Lake Placid, New York, commemorates the 1932 Winter Olympics and 1980 Winter Olympics, which were based in the village. It is the only Olympic museum in the United States and is a part of the work of New York State Olympic Regional Development Authority in the Lake Placid Olympic Region. Lake Placid is the only North American city to have hosted two separate Winter Olympics. The museum, which was opened by New York State in 1994, is located within the Olympic Center. Its collection includes the &quot;Fram III&quot; bobsled from the 1932 Olympic Games which had been missing for more than sixty years prior to being donated to the museum, the skates used by Jack Shea in the same games, as well as memorabilia from the 1980 Miracle on Ice hockey team. The museum also hosted the Olympic torch when it traveled the United States prior to the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. In addition to hosting the Lake Placid film forum, the museum's collection also provided materials for the 2004 movie Miracle, which focused on the 1980 hockey team. The museum was the recipient of the 2005 Olympic Cup, one of the oldest awards given by the International Olympic Committee, which recognizes institutions that have been active in the service of sport, and have contributed to the development of the Olympic Movement. It has benefited from and is augmented by the other Olympic institutions and programs located in and around Lake Placid which form part of former Governor Pataki's promotion of Lake Placid as a tourism destination. The museum draws between 25,000 and 35,000 visitors each year.</description>

            <name>Portrait Gallery of Canada</name>
            <description>The Portrait Gallery of Canada is a Canadian art collection specialising in portraiture. It was established on 23 January 2001 by the Government of Canada as a program of Library and Archives Canada. A plan to permanently house the collection in gallery in Ottawa, Ontario, across the street from the Parliament Buildings, was announced in 2001, and initial plans called for its opening in 2004/2005, but this plan is now defunct. Library and Archives Canada is instead partnering with museums, galleries and other institutions across the country to showcase the collection. Since the nineteenth century the Library has gathered an extensive collection of paintings and portraits, almost all of which are in storage in its archives in Gatineau, Quebec. The new gallery in Ottawa would have created a public location to display this collection. In the meantime, the Portrait Gallery of Canada is displaying its collection to the public in travelling exhibitions. Its &quot;Portraits in the Streets&quot; series brings portrait reproductions to urban areas of Canadian cities, including Ottawa, Quebec City, and, in 2010, Vancouver. Renovations and additions were underway until 2006 at the former location of the American Embassy, at 100 Wellington Street. It was intended that this building would house the gallery's collection upon its completion, projected for 2007, however in 2006, the project was put on hold by the Conservative government, who considered locating the museum in Calgary and for it to be partially funded by the energy company EnCana. In particular, there were discussions with EnCana about including the museum in the company's office tower currently under construction in Calgary. As of June 2007, construction of additional gallery space had not started, and two weeks later, EnCana announced that the gallery wouldn't be moving into their new office tower in Calgary. A competition for private sector corporations to house the collection attracted bids from Edmonton, Calgary, and Ottawa, but that competition was cancelled in November 2008. The idea of locating a gallery outside of Ottawa resulted in a motion before the Senate that would have made it illegal to move the gallery outside of Ottawa.</description>

The museum opened its doors on Presidents' Day, February 20, 1989. The museum is located in the old Texas School Book Depository building, at the intersection of Elm and Houston streets on Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, the location from which the Warren Commission found that Lee Harvey Oswald shot President Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

Ongoing public programming is extensive, including school activities, community events, lectures, films, symposia and collaborative performing arts events. Programmatic objectives focus on building audiences within the public schools and the FIU communities, while advancing The Wolfsonian’s international scholarly reputation.

            <name>Museum of the History of Science, Oxford</name>
            <address>Broad Street, Oxford, England</address>
            <description>The Museum of the History of Science, located in Broad Street, Oxford, is home to an unrivalled collection of scientific instruments from medieval times to the 17th century. Its collection of 18th and 19th-century instruments is also substantial. It is the world's oldest surviving purpose-built museum building. The current collection contains around 15,000 objects from antiquity to the early 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science and is used for both academic study and enjoyment by the visiting public. The museum contains a wide range of scientific instruments, such as quadrants, astrolabes (the most complete collection in the world with 136 instruments), sundials, early mathematical instruments, optical instruments, equipment associated with chemistry, natural philosophy and medicine, and a reference library regarding the history of scientific instruments that includes manuscripts, incunabula, prints and printed ephemera, and early photographic items. Built in 1683 to house Elias Ashmole's collection, the museum building became known as the Old Ashmolean Building (to distinguish it from the newer Ashmolean Museum building where the Ashmolean Museum of Art &amp;amp; Archaeology moved in 1894) and was the world's first purpose-built museum building; it was also open to the public. The original concept of the museum was to institutionalize the new learning about nature that appeared in the 17th century and experiments concerning philosophy were undertaken in a chemical laboratory in the basement, while lectures and demonstration took place in the School of Natural History, on the middle floor. Ashmole's collection was expanded to include a broad range of activities associated with the history of natural knowledge and in 1924 the gift of Lewis Evans' collection allowed the museum further improvement, becoming the Museum of the History of Science and appointing Robert Gunther as its first curator. The collection and the building itself now occupies a special position in the study of the history of science and in the development of western culture and collecting. One of the most iconic objects in the collection is a blackboard that Albert Einstein used on 16 May 1931 during his lectures while visiting Oxford, rescued by E. J. Bowen at the end of the lecture. From October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum hosted the first major exhibition of Steampunk art objects, curated by Art Donovan and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director. Admission is free and is open to the general public from noon until 5 p.m. , Tuesday to Friday, from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. on Sundays. (The museum closes for the Christmas and New Year period.)</description>

            <description>The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County opened in Exposition Park, Los Angeles, California, USA in 1913 as the Museum of History, Science, and Art. The moving force behind it was a museum association founded in 1910. Its distinctive main building, with fitted marble walls and domed and colonnaded rotunda, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Additional wings opened in 1925, 1930, 1960, and 1976. The museum was divided in 1961 into the Los Angeles County Museum of History and Science and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). LACMA moved to new quarters on Wilshire Boulevard in 1965, and the Museum of History and Science was renamed the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Eventually, the museum renamed itself again, becoming the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. In July 2010 the museum reopened its seismically retrofitted renovated 1913 Rotunda along with the new Age of Mammals exhibition. Currently the museum is in a new phase of development that will see its Dinosaur Mysteries exhibition open in mid 2011 and its history of California Under the Sun in late 2012. By that time the front of the building will be developed into 3.5 acres (14,000 m) of teaching -learning gardens as the new North Plaza. The museum is the largest in the western United States, and its collections include nearly 35 million specimens and artifacts</description>

            <description>The Amon Carter Museum of American Art is located in Fort Worth, Texas. It was established by the generosity of Amon G. Carter to house his collection of paintings and sculpture by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell. When the museum opened in 1961, its first director, Mitchell A. Wilder, sought a broader vision for its collection. Wilder believed that the grand story of American art could be interpreted as the history of many artists at different times working on “successive frontiers” in the great pageant of American history. As a result of this vision, the museum's collections began to expand in many fascinating ways, from the first landscape painters of the 1830s to modern artists of the twentieth century. Today, the collection includes masterworks by such artists as Alexander Calder, Thomas Cole, Stuart Davis, Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Georgia O'Keeffe, John Singer Sargent, Charles Demuth, Martin Johnson Heade and Alfred Stieglitz. The museum also possesses one of the premier collections of American photography in the nation, comprising more than 30,000 exhibition prints by some 400 photographers. The photography collection also includes the work and archives of several notable American photographers, including Laura Gilpin, Eliot Porter, and Karl Struss. The museum continues to collect American art and produces related programs, publications, and exhibitions. Philip Johnson, the museum’s original architect, designed and completed the building’s most recent expansion in 2001. The Amon G. Carter, Jr. , Exhibits Hall is located near the Carter Museum.</description>

The conservatory consists of four glass, pyramid-shaped structures that showcase plants from arid, tropical, and temperate climates, providing a welcome oasis of warmth during winter. The fourth pyramid hosts a theme that changes throughout the year. A donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining monies supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department. The conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger' pyramids are 660 square meters in area, and the two medium-sized ones are 410 square meters in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants.</description>

Among the exhibits in the ancient history section is an actual burial mound which was transported from its site in the desert and reassembled in the museum. Another feature is a tableau which depicts a scene from the Epic of Gilgamesh (in which reference to Bahrain is made as the paradise of Dilmun). Old Quranic manuscripts, notes on astronomy and historical documents and letters are exhibited in the Documents and Manuscripts Hall.

            <description>The Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA), located on the cultural boulevard of North Terrace in Adelaide, is the premier visual arts museum in the Australian state of South Australia. It has, after the National Gallery of Victoria, the largest state art collection in Australia. With a large collection of more than 35,000 works of art and more than 510,000 visitors annually, the AGSA is renowned for its leading collections of Australian art (notably Indigenous Australian and colonial art), British art (including a large collection by Morris &amp;amp; Co. ) and Japanese art. Located adjacent to State Library of South Australia, the South Australian Museum and the University of Adelaide, AGSA is part of Adelaide's North Terrace cultural precinct. The Gallery was established in 1881, and has existed at its current location since 1900. Subsequent renovations and a significant extension of the building which opened in 1996 added contemporary display space without compromising the interior of the original Victorian building. It was known as the National Gallery of South Australia until 1967 when the current name was adopted.</description>

            <address>United States</address>
            <description>Arts Club of Chicago is a private club located in the Near North Side community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States, a block east of the Magnificent Mile, that exhibits international contemporary art. It was founded in 1916, inspired by the success of the Art Institute of Chicago's handling of the Armory Show. Its founding was viewed as a statement that art had become an important component of civilized urban life. The Arts Club is said to have been pro-Modernist from its founding. The Club strove to break new ground with its shows, rather than collect the works of established artists as the Art Institute does. The club presented Pablo Picasso's first United States showing. In addition, the 1951 exhibition by Jean Dubuffet and his &quot;Anticultural Positions&quot; lecture at the Arts Club were tremendous influences on what would become the mid 1960s Imagist movement. Another important presentation in the history of the Arts Club was the Fernand Léger showing of Le Ballet Mecanique. The Club's 1997 move to its current 201 E. Ontario Street location was not without controversy, because the club demolished its former interior space designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and moved only the central staircase to the new gallery space. However, the new space is 19,000 square feet, which is 7,000 square feet (650 m) larger than the old space.</description>

            <description>The Bath Postal Museum is in Bath, Somerset, England. The museum was founded in 1979 by Audrey and Harold Swindells in the basement of their house. In 1984 it moved to a home in Broad Street. This was the site of Bath's main Post Office from 1822 to 1854 and the building in which the first recorded posting of a Penny Black took place on 2 May 1840. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. The museums collections include: biographies of key figures involved with the development of the Post Office and connected with Bath, such as Ralph Allen, John Palmer and Thomas Moore Musgrave; a history of the post from 2000BC to the current day and a history of the British postbox. Artefacts on display included quills and ink wells, stamp boxes, post boxes, post horns, clay tablets, strip maps, model mail coaches and, letters and postcards. There was also a replica Victorian post office. Due to vastly increased rent from 2003 the museum had to move out of the Broad Street building, and on 7 November 2006 it reopened on a much smaller scale in the basement of the post office building at 27 Northgate Street.

Conservatories were originally benevolent establishments attached to hospitals or other charitable or religious institutions. They provided plants and organisms for medicinal use and research. Nineteenth-century city dwellers, concerned with the ill effects of growing industrialization, became fascinated with horticulture. In Chicago, three park commissions were organized in 1869 and, by 1895, Chicago had five conservatories</description>

            <description>The Canadian Postal Museum (CPM) is housed within the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec. It has been described as one of the largest postal museums in the world, ranking second in annual attendance. The museum is not primarily about postage stamps, although it has a first-class collection that numbers in the tens of thousands. Rather, it presents the broader story of Canada’s postal heritage, including the social and economic importance of postal communications throughout the country’s history. It also explores international themes relating to postal communications. The museum’s collections include a writing desk that belonged to Sandford Fleming, designer of Canada’s first postage stamp; Canadian and foreign letter boxes and postal uniforms; mail bags and rural mail boxes; post office signs and sorting equipment. The museum has a permanent exhibition, complemented by temporary or special exhibitions. Among the highlights is Reflections of Canada: the National Stamp Collection, which includes examples of every postage stamp ever issued in Canada. In addition to its public exhibitions, the museum has a mandate to collect, preserve and interpret material objects relating to Canada’s postal heritage. The Canadian Postal Museum was established in 1971 and opened in 1974 as the National Postal Museum. It joined the Canadian Museum of Civilization in 1988, adopted its current name in 1996, and moved into a permanent space in the Museum of Civilization in 1997. The Postal Museum is managed by the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, a federal Crown Corporation that is also responsible for the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the Canadian War Museum, the Canadian Children's Museum, and the Virtual Museum of New France.</description>

            <address>1050 Joan Crescent Victoria, British Columbia, Canada</address>
            <description>Craigdarroch Castle in Victoria, British Columbia, is a historic, Victorian-era Châteauesque mansion comprising 39 rooms and over 20,000 square feet (1,900 m). It was constructed in the 1890s as a family residence for the wealthy coal baron Robert Dunsmuir and his wife Joan. Robert died in April 1889, more than a year before construction on the castle was completed. His sons Alexander and James took over the role of finishing the castle after his death. The initial architect of the castle, Warren Williams, also died before completion of the castle. His work was taken over by his associate, Arthur L. Smith, in 1890. James Dunsmuir also commissioned the construction of Victoria's second castle; Hatley Castle located in Colwood, British Columbia. Craigdarroch Castle is believed to have cost as much as $500,000 when it was built, and included granite from British Columbia, tile from San Francisco, and an oak staircase prefabricated in Chicago. When originally constructed Craigdarroch stood in grounds comprising 27 acres of formal gardens in Victoria's Rockland neighbourhood. Upon the death of Robert Dunsmuir's widow, Joan, the Craigdarroch estate was sold to land speculator Griffith Hughes for $38,000 who subdivided the estate into buildings lots. To stimulate sales during a slow real estate market, Griffiths announced that the castle would be the subject of a raffle, to be won by one of the purchasers of the residential parcels carved from the estate. The winner, Solomon Cameron, mortgaged the castle to finance other speculative ventures which failed, leaving him broke, and in 1919 ownership of the castle passed to one of Cameron's creditors, the Bank of Montreal. The four-story Craigdarroch Castle still has lavish furnishings from the 1890s and is known for its stained-glass and intricate woodwork. The Castle is currently owned by the Craigdarroch Castle Historical Museum Society, which is a private non-profit society, and is open to the public. The castle is a tourist attraction, and receives 150,000 visitors a year.</description>

            <description>Children's Museum of Caracas (Fundación Museo de los Niños) is a privately managed museum foundation in Caracas, Venezuela's capital city, established in 1982 and aimed at teaching children about science, technology, culture and arts. At the beginning of 1974, the great challenge was materialize a museum for children, with the mission of contribute to the formation and recreation of the childhood, by the teaching of science, technology, arts and the fundamental values of the society, to constitute a center of scientific spreading for the Venezuelan children. In order to determine the areas of the knowledge to those who the museum would be dedicated, they were considered: the information collected in the different centers and science museums, the analysis of the interests of the children and the characteristics of the Venezuelan young people, the necessity to reinforce the knowledge acquired in the school, the deficiency of the institutes where the child could learn science by recreatives forms, the conviction that a science and technology museum has in the diffusion of the knowledge to improve the future generations. Like result, the basic areas of the museum would be: Biology, Communication, Ecology and Physics, through exhibitions and experiences directed mainly to children between 6 and 14 years. On August 7, 1982, the Children's Museum of Caracas, the first museum for children of Latin America, opened its doors, the dream became true. Years later, was taken the decision to make a permanent exhibition about the space and the advances of astronomy and astronautics. In 1987 the contacts with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other North American institutions began, to make a rigorous investigation and determine what would exhibit the museum. Inaugurated on October 12, 1993, the new building increased the capacity of visitors, multiplied the number of ticket offices, extended the administrative dependencies and the service to the public. The original landscaping of the Parque Central Complex was respected, in addition, green areas around the infantile park were created, that increase the benefit of the young visitors as of the community. The Children's Museum of Caracas is for kids, where is possible to learn in a didactic way, it gives to the children another point of view of the world, previously reinforces the learned knowledge, and makes the learn of new subjects. In this museum we can find different sectors, each one with a respective subject: Biology, Communication, Physics, Ecology, the Conquest of space, Art Rooms, The emotion of live… without drugs, the Planetarium, among others, it has more than 500 exhibitions, that allow the children to amuse themselves while they learn. One of the great attractions of the museum is the planetarium, that is within the Conquest of space, which has a small additional cost. In addition to guided tours, the Children's Museum conducts workshops, special vacation programs for children and highly structured events for schools.</description>

            <description>The Chrysler Museum of Art is an art museum in the Ghent district of Norfolk, Virginia. The museum was originally founded in 1933 as the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences. In 1971, automotive heir, Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. (whose wife, Jean Outland Chrysler, was a native of Norfolk), donated most of his extensive collection to the museum. This single gift significantly expanded the museum's collection, making it one of the major art museums in the Southeastern United States. From 1958 to 1971, the Chrysler Museum of Art was a smaller museum consisting solely of Chrysler's personal collection and housed in the historic Center Methodist Church in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Today's museum sits on a small body of water known as The Hague in the Ghent district, near downtown Norfolk.</description>

            <description>The Civil War and Underground Railroad Museum of Philadelphia (formerly the Civil War Library and Museum) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, claims to be the oldest chartered American Civil War institution in the United States. The museum was founded in 1888 by veteran officers of the Union Army, Navy and Marine Corps. On August 7, 2007, the museum announced that it would relocate to the former First Bank of the United States building, near Independence Hall. It was previously located at 1805 Pine Street near Rittenhouse Square. Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street presented the museum with a check for $1.2 million to assist in its relocation. On August 2, 2008, the Pine Street location permanently closed and the museum planned to reopen in its new location in 2011. In 2009, Governor Ed Rendell canceled the state's portion of the funding needed to relocate the museum, prompting the National Park Service to withdraw its offer to use the First Bank building. The museum's collection remains in storage pending the designation of a new permanent home.</description>

            <description>The Marine Museum of Manitoba, at Selkirk, Manitoba, was established in 1972 to gather ships, artifacts, and items relating to shipping, to tell the story of the development and the operation of transportation on Lake Winnipeg and the Red River. The period covered by the Museum's displays starts circa 1850 and continues to present day. The Marine Museum is a non-profit organization operated by a board of local citizens operating under the name of The Marine Museum of Manitoba (Selkirk) Inc. With support from the City of Selkirk and nearby businesses, as well as from both the provincial and federal government, the museum’s purpose is to collect, preserve, research, exhibit and interpret its collection of historical artifacts. Among its collection of ships, the Motor Ship Keenora was the first acquired by the museum. Abandoned in the Selkirk Slough in 1966, the MS Keenora was purchased from Marine Transport Navigation Company in 1972, by a group of twenty Selkirk businessmen. In the summer of 1973 the Keenora was removed from the waters of the Red River on the Selkirk dry dock, then dragged on its keel, across the grass of Selkirk Park, to its present location, near the park entrance.</description>

The museum also has a large collection of Meissen porcelain. On 02010-01-25 January 25, 2010, the Cummer Gardens were added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Museum opened in 1961 on the grounds of the former residence of Arthur and Ninah Cummer. There are three flower gardens on the museum grounds, the oldest dating back to 1903. The permanent collection of the Museum currently includes over six thousand works of art dating from 2100 B.C. to the 21st century. Art Connections is a nationally known education center that increases the cultural learning of over 50,000 students each year and offers hands-on-art experiences for the museum visitors. The Museum is housed in a series of modest 20th century buildings, but opens onto the St. Johns River, an historic and active Florida waterway. In early 2002 the Museum began a series of initiatives to study its future space needs, and acquired the adjacent historic Woman's Club of Jacksonville, a Tudor style residential building which will serve as a public programs and events center for the Museum. The project received a 2009 award from the Jacksonville Historical Commission.</description>

National Museum of Pakistan was established in Frere Hall on April 17, 1950, replacing the defunct Victoria Museum. Frere Hall itself was built in 1865 as a tribute to Sir Bartle Frere, a Commissioner of Sind during the 19th century. The basic objective of establishing National Museum was to collect, preserve, study, and exhibit the records of the cultural history of Pakistan and to promote a learned insight into the personality of its people. Once the Museum was inaugurated then the Government of Pakistan deemed it wise to constitute an Advisory Council in 1950 with a primary duty to counsel the Museum on the issues of enriching its collection through new acquisitions and purchase of antiquities and works of Arts.</description>

The museum has a large collection of various designs of hovercraft - numbering over sixty at the last count. Situated at HMS Daedalus by the large slipway from where many hovercraft have been tested, the museum collection includes SR.N5 and SR.N6 hovercraft, one of which is fully operational. The collection currently contains the last two remaining SR.N4 craft, the world's largest civil hovercraft which have been laid up here since their retirement from cross-Channel services on 1 October 2000. The future of these vessels is uncertain, as they are privately owned and are possibly up for sale. The museum houses the world's largest library of documents, publications, film, video, photographs and drawings on hovercraft, all of which is available for research by prior arrangement. Indeed many former hovercraft manufacturers have deposited their complete archives with the museum for safekeeping, thus swelling this important repository of information. The museum also contains a large collection of original manufacturer's hovercraft models including the world's first working hovercraft model built by Christopher Cockerell.</description>

            <description>The Minnesota Streetcar Museum (MSM) is a transport museum that operates two heritage streetcar lines in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the western suburb of Excelsior. The museum was created as part of the restructuring of the Minnesota Transportation Museum in the winter of 2004&amp;ndash;2005. The museum was founded in 1962 to restore a streetcar, Twin City Rapid Transit Company No. 1300, that had been operated by the TCRT until the last streetcar lines were abandoned in favor of buses in 1954. Over time, the museum diversified to include diesel and steam-powered trains, buses, steamboats, and associated buildings, papers, and photographs. When the museum was restructured in the winter of 2004 and 2005, the Minnesota Streetcar Museum assumed ownership of and responsibility for operation of the two streetcar lines. The Museum of Lake Minnetonka was created to operate a restored TCRT steamboat, the Minnehaha, which was built by TCRT in 1906, one of seven boats built in a design similar to the company's home-built streetcars. The Minnesota Streetcar Museum now has five operable streetcars, three from TCRT's fleet and two from the Duluth Street Railway Company. As of 2009, a streetcar from Winona, Minnesota is currently under restoration while a Fargo (North Dakota)-Moorhead Birney streetcar and a Mesaba Railway interurban car await restoration.</description>

            <description>Goulandris Museum of Natural History in Athens was founded by Angelos Goulandris and Niki Goulandris in 1965 in order to promote interest in the natural sciences, to raise the awareness of the public, in general, and in particular to call its attention to the need to protect Greece's natural wildlife habitats and species in the danger of extinction. The museum includes large collections of insects, mammals, birds, reptiles, shells, rocks, minerals and fossils, from the rich natural wildlife of the Greek territory. The botanical collections number over 200.000 species of plants, among which there are 145 newly-discovered ones, which have been recorded thanks to the museum's research. The kernel of the botanical collection was formed when it acquired the collection of Constantine Goulimis, the author of Wild Flowers of Greece that was illustrated by Niki Goulandris. In the museum's laboratories, scientific research is being carried out in the areas of ecology, botany, zoology, geology, palaeontology and biotechnology. In the exhibition rooms are presented in detail the variety and interdependence of the biocommunities and the floral, animal and geological wealth of Greece. The Goulandris Museum of Natural History also functions as a complementary educational institution for all levels of education. Its activities include further education programmes, seminars, lectures, the publication of books and other material, and itinerant exhibitions on crucial environmental issues in Greece and abroad. The Museum is linked to international organizations and to Institutes of Higher Education. Some of the most important exhibits of the museum are the Zoology Room, the Palaeontology Room and the display of bivalve molluscs from various parts of the world.</description>

León, Spain</address>
            <description>The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León, better known as the MUSAC, is an art museum in the city of León, Spain. Inaugurated in April 2005 by Felipe, Prince of Asturias, this cultural institution aims to be a &quot;Museum of the Present&quot;, in the words of its curator Agustín Pérez Rubio, and thus only collects artworks from the latest generation of artists, between 1992 and 2012. The museum has won international prestige for its 21st-century collection and innovative programming, being labelled, for example, as &quot;one of the most astonishingly bold museums to hit the Spanish cultural landscape in years&quot; by The New York Times. The MUSAC building is celebrated for its avant-garde architecture, and it has been awarded a number of prizes, such as the 2007 European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture (Mies van der Rohe award). Designed by the architectural studio of Luis M. Mansilla and Emilio Tuñón, the multicolored panels that adorn the exterior of the museum resemble the stained-glass windows of a cathedral. Indeed, the architects drew their inspiration for this work from the main rose window (called The Falconer) at the local 13th century Gothic cathedral, Santa María de León. MUSAC has become a landmark for the city of León, and an emblem of the new 21st century Spanish architecture, as showcased in a 2006 exhibition at the MoMA of New York City, which selected the MUSAC as one of the arquitectural projects that make Spain today &quot;an international center for design innovation and excellence&quot;.</description>

            <description>The British Museum is a museum of human history and culture in London. Its collections, which number more than seven million objects, are amongst the largest and most comprehensive in the world and originate from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759 in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington in 1887. Some objects in the collection, most notably the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, are the objects of intense controversy and calls for restitution to their countries of origin. Until 1997, when the British Library (previously centred on the Round Reading Room) moved to a new site, the British Museum was unique in that it housed both a national museum of antiquities and a national library in the same building. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee. Since 2002 the director of the museum has been Neil MacGregor.. Conservative Peer Lord Sainsbury has pledged to donate £25 million to the Museum to aid funding for a large scale extension, set to make it the world's largest museum by collection upon completion.</description>

            <description>The National Gallery of Victoria is an art gallery and museum in Melbourne, Australia. Founded in 1861, it is the oldest and the largest public art gallery in Australia. The main gallery is located in St Kilda Road, in the heart of the Melbourne Arts Precinct of Southbank, with a branch gallery at Federation Square. At the time when the gallery opened, Victoria was an independent colony for just ten years, but in the wake of the Victorian gold rush, it was easily the richest part of Australia, and Melbourne the largest city. Generous gifts from wealthy citizens, notably industrialist Alfred Felton, made it possible for the National Gallery to start purchasing large collections of overseas works from both old and modern masters. It currently holds 63,000 works of art. The National Gallery of Victoria Art School, associated with the gallery, was founded in 1867. It was the leading centre for academic art training in Australia until about 1910. The School’s graduates went on to become some of Australia’s most significant artists.</description>

            <description>The Victoria and Albert Museum (often abbreviated as the V&amp;amp;A), set in the South Kensington district of The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, housing a permanent collection of over 4.5 million objects. Named after Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, it was founded in 1852, and has since grown to now cover 12.5 acres (51,000 m) and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, in virtually every medium, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world. The museum possesses the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, the holdings of Italian Renaissance items are the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection, alongside the Musée du Louvre and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, is amongst the largest in the world. Alongside other neighbouring institutions, including the Natural History Museum and Science Museum, the V&amp;amp;A is located in what is termed London's &quot;Albertopolis&quot;, an area of immense cultural, scientific and educational importance. Since 2001, the Museum has embarked on a major £150m renovation programme which has seen a major overhaul of the departments including the introduction of newer galleries, gardens, shops and visitor facilities. Following in similar vein to other national UK museums, entrance to the museum has been free since 2001.</description>

            <description>The Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge, located on Trumpington Street opposite Fitzwilliam Street in central Cambridge, England. It receives around 300,000 visitors annually. Admission is free. The museum was founded in 1816 with the bequest of the library and art collection of the 7th Viscount FitzWilliam. The bequest also included £100,000 &quot;to cause to be erected a good substantial museum repository&quot;. The collection was initially placed in the old Perse School building in Free School Lane. It was moved in 1842 to the Old Schools (at that time the University Library). The &quot;Founder's Building&quot; itself was designed by George Basevi, completed by C. R. Cockerell and opened in 1848; the entrance hall is by Edward Middleton Barry and was completed in 1875. The first stone of the new building was laid by Gilbert Ainslie in 1837. A two story extension, paid for partly by the Courtauld family, was added in 1931. The Egyptian Galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum reopened in 2006 after a two-year, £1.5 million programme of refurbishment, conservation and research.</description>

            <description>The Saatchi Gallery is a London gallery for contemporary art, opened by Charles Saatchi in 1985 in order to exhibit his collection to the public. It has occupied different premises, first in North London, then the South Bank by the River Thames and currently in Chelsea. Saatchi's collection, and hence the gallery's shows, has had distinct phases, starting with U.S. artists and minimalism, moving to the Damien Hirst-led Young British Artists, followed by shows purely of painting and then returning to contemporary art from America in USA Today at the Royal Academy in London. In 2008, an exhibition of contemporary Chinese art formed the inaugural exhibition in the new venue for the gallery at the Duke of York's HQ. The gallery has been a major influence on art in Britain since its opening. It has also had a history of media controversy, which it has courted, and has had extremes of critical reaction. Many artists shown at the gallery are unknown not only to the general public but also to the commercial art world: showing at the gallery has provided a springboard to launch careers. In 2010 it was announced that the gallery would be given to the British public, becoming the Museum of Contemporary Art for London.</description>

            <name>Philadelphia Museum of Art</name>
            <address>2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia</address>
            <description>The Philadelphia Museum of Art is among the largest art museums in the United States. It is located at the west end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. The Museum was established in 1876 in conjunction with the Centennial Exposition of the same year. Originally called the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, its founding was inspired by the South Kensington Museum in London, which grew out of the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Museum, at that time housed in the Centennial Exposition's Memorial Hall, opened its doors to the public on May 10, 1877. While this location was adequate, it was remote from the vast majority of the city's inhabitants. Construction of the current building began in 1919 when Mayor Thomas B. Smith laid the cornerstone in a Masonic ceremony on the former reservoir land of the decommissioned Fairmount Water Works covering 10 acres (40,000 m) of ground. The first section was completed in early 1928. The quasi-Greek Revival design was produced by Horace Trumbauer and the firm of Zantzinger, Borie and Medary. The facade of the building is of Minnesota dolomite. The pediment facing the parkway is adorned with sculptures by C. Paul Jennewein depicting Greek gods and goddesses. There is also a collection of griffins, which were adopted as the symbol of the museum in the 1970s. The Museum's building is fondly nicknamed the Parthenon on the Parkway. For the better part of a century the McIlhenny family held an important relationship with the Museum. Henry P. McIlhenny was involved for almost half a century, first as curator from 1939 to 1964, then as chairman of the board in 1976 until his death in 1986, when he left the bulk of his estate to the Museum. The institution describes itself as &quot;one of the largest museums in the United States&quot;, and its collections comprise more than 225,000 objects. Though the Museum houses over 200 galleries spanning 2,000 years, it does not have any galleries devoted to Egyptian, Roman, or Pre-Columbian art. This is because a partnership between the Museum and the University of Pennsylvania had been enacted early in the Museum's history. The University loaned the Museum its collection of Chinese porcelain, and the Museum loaned a majority of its Roman, Pre-Columbian, and Egyptian pieces to the University. However, the Museum keeps a few important pieces for special exhibitions.

            <address>United States</address>
            <description>The Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM) is located on Lake Michigan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Starting around 1872, multiple organizations were founded in order to bring an art gallery to Milwaukee, as the city was still a growing port town with little or no places to hold major art exhibitions. Over at least nine years, all attempts to build a major art gallery had failed. In 1881, exhibitions were held at Milwaukee's Exposition Hall, which was Milwaukee's primary event venue at the time. Shortly after that year, Alexander Mitchell donated all of her collection into constructing Milwaukee's first permanent art gallery in the city's history. The museum's history began in 1882 when the Milwaukee Museum of Fine Arts was founded. The museum dissolved six years later. In 1888, the Milwaukee Art Association was created by a group of German panorama artists and local businessmen; its first home was the Layton Art Gallery. In 1911, the Milwaukee Art Institute, another building constructed to hold other exhibitions and collections, was completed. The institute was built right next to the Layton Art Gallery. Alfred George Pelikan, who received his Masters in Fine Arts (MFA) from Columbia University, was the Director of the Milwaukee Art Institute from 1926 to 1942. The Milwaukee Art Center (now the Milwaukee Art Museum) was formed when the Milwaukee Art Institute and Layton Art Gallery merged their collections in 1957 and moved into a three-story building underneath the Eero Saarinen-designed Milwaukee County War Memorial. The museum is home to over 25,000 works of art. Its permanent holdings contain an important collection of Old Masters and 19th-century and 20th-century artwork, as well as some of the nation's best collections of German Expressionism, folk and Haitian art, American decorative arts, and post-1960 American art. The museum holds a large number of works by Georgia O'Keeffe, as well as many works by the German Expressionist, Gabriele Munter. The MAM recently gained international recognition with the construction of the white concrete Quadracci Pavilion, designed by Santiago Calatrava (his first completed project in the United States), which opened on May 4, 2001. The pavilion was engineered by the Milwaukee-based engineering firm, Graef. The structure contains a movable, wing-like brise soleil which opens up for a wingspan of 217 feet during the day, folding over the tall, arched structure at night or during inclement weather. The brise soleil has since become a symbol for the city of Milwaukee. In addition to a gallery devoted to temporary exhibits, the pavilion also houses the museum's store, as well as its restaurant, Cafe Calatrava. With the exception of the temporary exhibition gallery, the galleries themselves are contained in both the Saarinen building and a 1975 addition designed by local architect David Kahler. This addition was commissioned in 1969 to make room for other exhibits and donations.</description>

            <address>Stoke Heath, Bromsgrove, England</address>
            <description>Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings is an open-air museum of rescued buildings which have been relocated to its site in Stoke Heath, a district of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, England. Founded in 1963 and opened in 1967, the museum was conceived following the dismantling of a 15th-century timber-framed house in Bromsgrove in 1962 to provide a location for its reconstruction. It became England's first open-air museum and the second in the UK. This building is known as the 'Merchant's House' today, though it has been known by other names in the past, including the 'Bromsgrove House' and the 'Tudor House'. It now houses a collection of domestic, industrial, agricultural and other forms of historic building, the majority dismantled and re-erected. The museum's collection comprises 27 buildings and structures which have been relocated from their original sites under threat of demolition, being rebuilt and restored at the museum. This includes a fully functioning windmill and a post WW2 prefab house as used in many towns and cities after the Second World War to provide quick affordable replacements for houses destroyed by bombing. The Arcon V prefabricated house was originally constructed on Moat Lane in Yardley, Birmingham and was transported to the museum in 1981. Weddings and receptions are frequently held in The New Guesten Hall, a building at the museum which was built to incorporate the preserved timber roof of Guesten Hall, originally built next to Worcester Cathedral for entertaining the Prior's guests. The New Guesten Hall is also used by outside parties for concerts, conferences, exhibitions and meetings. The museum's Victorian church, originally built in 1891 at Bringsty Common, Herefordshire, was opened and re-dedicated in 1996 and services are held there during the museum's open season. The church is also licensed for wedding blessings. The other exhibits, which span over 700 years of history, include a perry mill from Redditch, a toll house from Little Malvern, a fibreglass spire from Smethwick, an earth closet, a cruck-frame barn, a counting house and more.</description>

            <description>The Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) has one of the largest, most significant art collections in the United States. In 2003, the DIA ranked as the second largest municipally-owned museum in the United States, with an art collection valued at more than one billion dollars. With over 100 galleries, it now covers 677,000 square feet (62,893 m²); a major renovation and expansion project completed in 2007 added 77,000 sq. ft. (7,153 m²). The museum building itself is highly regarded by architects. Its original building, designed by Paul Philippe Cret is flanked by north and south wings covered with a white marble exterior. It is part of the city's Cultural Center Historic District listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Its first painting was donated in 1883 and its collection consists of over 65,000 works. The DIA is an encyclopedic museum, not a specialist one: its collections span the globe from ancient Egyptian works to contemporary art. The DIA is located in Midtown Detroit's Cultural Center, about two miles (3 km) north of the downtown area, near Wayne State University. The museum has also published an introductory visitor's guide. The Detroit Institute of Arts contains the 1,150-seat Detroit Film Theatre and hosts major art exhibitions.</description>

            <description>Beamish, The North of England Open Air Museum is an open-air museum located at Beamish, near the town of Stanley, County Durham, England. The museum's guiding principle is to preserve an example of everyday life in urban and rural North East England at the climax of industrialisation in the early 20th century. Much of the restoration and interpretation is specific to 1913, together with portions of countryside under the influence of industrial revolution in 1825. On its 300-acre estate it utilises a mixture of translocated, original and replica buildings; a huge collection of artifacts, working vehicles and equipment; as well as livestock and costumed interpreters. The museum has received a number of prestigious awards since it opened its present site to visitors in 1972 and has been influential on other &quot;living museums&quot;. It is a significant educational resource, and helps to preserve some traditional north-country and rare livestock breeds.</description>

With 45,000 square metres (480,000 sq ft) of physical space, the AGO is the 10th largest art museum in North America. Its collection includes more than 68,000 works spanning the 1st century to the present-day. It includes the world's largest collection of Canadian art, which depicts the development of Canada's heritage from pre-Confederation to the present. Indeed, works by Canadian artists make up more than half of the AGO's collection. The museum also has an impressive collection of European art, including the most important collection of Medieval and Renaissance decorative arts outside Europe and the United States, major works by Tintoretto, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt van Rijn, Thomas Gainsborough, Anthony van Dyck, Emile Antoine Bourdelle, and Frans Hals, and works by other renowned artists such as Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin, Vincent Van Gogh, and Edgar Degas. In addition to these, the AGO also has one of the most significant collections of African art in North America, as well as a contemporary art collection illustrating the evolution of modern artistic movements in Canada, the United States, and Europe, including works by Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, and Jenny Holzer. Finally, the AGO is home to the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, which houses the largest public collection of works by this British sculptor. Moore's bronze work, Two Large Forms (1966&amp;ndash;1969) greets visitors at the museum's north façade, at the intersection of Dundas and McCaul Streets.</description>

            <description>The Museum of Contemporary Art, often abbreviated to MCA, is a contemporary art museum near Water Tower Place in downtown Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The museum, which was established in 1967, is one of the world's largest contemporary art venues. The museum's collection is composed of thousands of objects of Post-World War II visual art. It had its first showroom in the building of a former baking factory. The museum has hosted several notable debut exhibitions including Frida Kahlo's first U.S. exhibition and Jeff Koons' first solo museum exhibition. Koons later presented an exhibit at the Museum that established the museum's current attendance record for an exhibition. Its collection, which includes Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Alexander Calder, contains historical samples of 1940s&amp;ndash;1970s late surrealism, pop art, minimalism, and conceptual art; notable holdings 1980s postmodernism; as well as contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation, and related media. The museum also presents dance, theater, music, and interdisciplinary arts. The current location at 220 East Chicago Avenue is in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area. The current building was designed by Josef Paul Kleihues after a funding drive spearheaded by major contributions by its own board members. The museum moved to the new building in 1996; it was originally located at 237 East Ontario Street. The building is known for its long staircase leading to an elevated ground floor which has an atrium the full glass-walled front and back giving a see through view to Lake Michigan.</description>

            <description>The Rubin Museum of Art (RMA) is a museum dedicated to the collection, display, and preservation of the art of the Himalayas and surrounding regions, especially that of Tibet. It is located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The Rubin Museum originated from a private collection of Himalayan art, which Donald Rubin, the founder of the managed-health-care network MultiPlan, Inc. , and his wife Shelley had been compiling since 1974. In 1998, the Rubins purchased the building of the former Barneys emporium in Chelsea, a former department store for designer fashion, which had filed for bankruptcy at the time, for $22 million. The building was remodelled as a museum by preservation architects Beyer Blinder Belle. The original 6-story spiral staircase was left intact to become the center of the 25,000 square feet (2,300 m) of exhibition space. The museum was opened in October 2004 and has been displaying a total of more than 1,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, textiles, as well as ritual objects from the 2nd to the 20th century. The new facade on 17th Street and the five floors of galleries take cues from Tibetan art and were conceived by the New York-based museum architects, Celia Imrey and Tim Culbert The graphic identity was conceived by the noted designer Milton Glaser. Besides exhibitions based on RMA's own permanent collection, the museum also serves as a venue for national and international traveling exhibitions. The museum is affiliated with two organizations—the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center and the Himalayan Art Website to advance the study of Himalayan arts and culture.</description>

            <address>Parks Road, Oxford, England</address>
            <description>The Pitt Rivers Museum is a museum displaying the archaeological and anthropological collections of the University of Oxford. The museum is located to the east of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and can only be accessed through that building. The museum was founded in 1884 by General Augustus Pitt Rivers, who donated his collection to the University of Oxford with the condition that a permanent lecturer in anthropology must be appointed. Museum staff are involved in teaching Archaeology and Anthropology at the University even today. The original donation consisted of approximately 20,000 items, which have now grown to 500,000 items, many of which have been donated by travellers, scholars and missionaries. The museum's collection is arranged thematically, according to how the objects were used, rather than according to their age or origin. This layout owes a lot to the theories of General Pitt Rivers himself, who intended for his collection to show progression in design and evolution in human culture from simple to complex. While this evolutionary approach to material culture is no longer accepted in archaeology and anthropology, the museum has retained the original organisation of the displays. The display of many examples of a particular type of tool or artifact, showing historical and regional variations, is an unusual and distinct feature of this museum. The museum has an incredibly high density of objects on display, and the displays are regularly changed. In 2004, the museum received £3,700,000 from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to build a research annexe adjoining the museum. Building work was completed in 2007, bringing the academic staff of the museum back to the site, and providing a laboratory for conservation of the specimens. The annex will not affect the Victorian displays of the museum. The second phase of development began on July 7, 2008 necessitating the closure of the museum and galleries. The museum reopened on 1st May 2009. In this work, the 1960s exhibition gallery was dismantled, restoring the original view through to the Museum’s totem pole. Original display cases were returned to their original place at the front of the Museum. The space upstairs vacated by these cases provides additional space for a Clore Duffield Education Centre. A new entrance platform allows visitors to enter on the same level as the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and improves access for wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs. The entrance platform provides re-located shop and reception areas. An environmental control system has also been installed. The Pitt Rivers Museum, along with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, won The Guardian's award for Family Friendly Museum of 2005.</description>

            <description>The National Football Museum was a museum in Preston, Lancashire, England, founded to preserve, conserve and interpret several important collections of association football memorabilia. It was built outside Deepdale, which as of 2010 is the oldest continuously used football league ground in the world. Its president was Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton. The trustees have voted to move the museum to the Urbis exhibition centre in Manchester, with Preston becoming a secondary site. However, this depends on funding from Manchester City Council and the North West Development Agency. The FA, however, are reported to be committed to spending around £10million on a state-of-the-art museum at Wembley by 2011. On 30 April 2010, the museum was closed after a meeting between the Lancashire County Council consortium, Manchester City Council, and the Trustees of the National Football Museum resulted in a decision to open a new museum in Manchester at the Urbis exhibition centre in 2011. After initial hope that the Preston museum could be kept open as a &quot;public face&quot; for football history in the city, the inability of the Lancashire County Council and museum's Trustees to agree on funding confirmed the permanent closure of the museum.</description>

            <description>The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art houses the most comprehensive collection of the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany found anywhere, a major collection of American art pottery, and fine collections of late-19th and early-20th century American paintings, graphics and the decorative arts. It is located in Winter Park, Florida, USA. The museum was founded by Jeannette Genius McKean in 1942 and named for her grandfather. She had long been an appreciator of Tiffany's art during times when his reputation had faded from sight. It was originally named as The Morse Gallery of Art and located on the campus of Rollins College. In 1957, the McKeans learned from one of Tiffany's daughters that his estate, Laurelton Hall, had burned to a ruin. Jeannette McKean decided to rescue the Tiffany treasures, which were ready to be bulldozed with the debris from the fire. Her husband Hugh McKean, who had been an art student at Tiffany's Laurelton Hall estate in 1930, remembered her exact words at the scene of the devastation: &quot;Let's buy everything that is left and try to save it. &quot; Later Tiffany acquisitions included the parts of his 1893 chapel for the World's Columbian Exposition.</description>

Its outdoor monuments surrounding a pool are dedicated to the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs, with a Space Shuttle monument planned. A nearby museum houses related exhibits and artifacts. Its mission statement is &quot;To preserve the history of the United States space program, to honor the men and women who made space flight a reality and the astronauts who flew the missions, and to educate the global community about the history of space exploration and its benefits to humankind. &quot; It describes itself as &quot;The first and only Walk in the nation that honors America's astronauts as well as the men and women behind the scenes who helped America lead the world in space exploration and accomplishments. &quot; The display was created by the non-profit US Space Walk of Fame Foundation (USSWOFF) composed of community leaders, aerospace industry officials and current and retired space workers. The foundation is also building a database, currently including more than 10,000 names, of space workers and their employers; and has received a grant to record oral histories from many of the men and women associated with the early US space program. &quot;We need to remember the people who made it possible, so little is said of them. &quot; &amp;mdash;Alan Shepard, May 13, 1996</description>

            <address>Mount Vernon Baltimore, Maryland</address>
            <description>The Walters Art Museum, located in Baltimore, Maryland's Mount Vernon neighborhood, is a public art museum founded in 1934. The museum's collection was amassed substantially by two men, William Thompson Walters (1819-1894), who began serious collecting when he moved to Paris at the outbreak of the American Civil War, and his son Henry Walters (1848–1931), who refined the collection and rehoused it in a palazzo building on Charles Street which opened in 1909. Upon his death, Henry Walters bequeathed the collection of over 22,000 works and the original Charles Street palazzo building to the city of Baltimore, “for the benefit of the public. ” The collection touches masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, and Art Deco jewelry. In 2000, the Walters Art Gallery changed its name to the Walters Art Museum to reflect its image as a large public institution. The following year, the museum reopened its largest building after a dramatic three-year renovation. The Walters Art Museum is where the Archimedes Palimpsest is on loan from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies. Starting Sunday, October 1, 2006, the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum began having free admission year-round as a result of grants given by Baltimore City and Baltimore County.

            <description>Kingman Museum is a natural history museum and planetarium located at 175 Limit Street, on the grounds of Leila Arboretum, in Battle Creek, Michigan, USA. Its mission is to promote an understanding and appreciation of the natural world, the universe, and human cultures. The Museum's collections include several thousand artifacts, many of which are displayed in permanent and temporary exhibitions. The vast majority of the collection, however, is in storage. In 2007 the Museum received a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to physically inventory and catalog every item in its collection. This massive project is scheduled for completion in August of 2009. Some of the Museum's highlights include its paleontology and geology specimens, animal taxidermy mounts, a preserved human embryo and fetus exhibit, and Native American artifacts. The Museum also has numerous rare items in its collection, including two specimens of the likely-to-be extinct Imperial Woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis). Only 120 museum specimens of the bird are known to exist in the world. Since there are no known photographs or recordings of a living Imperial Woodpecker these specimens are the only records ornithologists have to study and understand the species. In 2008 Kingman Museum added a Digistar 3 fulldome projector system to its planetarium. It is one of only 61 installations worldwide and the only one in southwest Michigan. Kingman is a member museum of the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) and participates in the membership passport program.</description>

The museum researches, catalogs, preserves, and exhibits literary artifacts. As part of its multilingual, multi-ethnic focus, it holds a large collection of local works in Taiwanese, Japanese, Mandarin, and Classical Chinese. It was planned as a national-level organization to fill in a long-perceived gap in how the Republic of China's institutions had handled the island's literature as a field of academic inquiry and popular discourse. The Council for Cultural Affairs under the Executive Yuan set up the initial planning office. Tainan was chosen for its historical significance as a cultural center. The museum is housed in the former Tainan City Hall, itself a national historical monument.</description>

She led the Atheneum from its first headquarters, a residence property of general Vicencio Pérez Soto. In 1942, there was a change of both, president and location. The presidency went to the hands of the actress Anna Julia Rojas. The new location was the place of birth of educator Andrés Bello. It would not be until 1983 that the Caracas Athenaeum would obtain its current location. This building was designed by Gustavo Legorburu, who won the National Prize of Architecture for it that same year.</description>

            <description>Heide Museum of Modern Art, more commonly just Heide, is a contemporary art museum located in Bulleen, east of Melbourne, Australia. Established in 1981, the museum comprises several detached buildings and surrounding gardens &amp;amp; parklands of historical importance that are used as gallery spaces to exhibit works in various mediums by contemporary Australian artists. The museum occupies the site of a former dairy farm that was purchased by the prominent Melbourne art collectors John and Sunday Reed in 1934 and became home to a collective known as the Heide Circle, which included many of Australia's best-known modernist painters, such as; Albert Tucker, Sidney Nolan, Laurence Hope Joy Hester and others, who lived and worked in the former farm house (Heide I). Between 1964 and 1967, a new residence was built (Heide II). It is considered to be one of the finest examples of modernist architecture in Victoria. In 1981, the museum was established on the site, incorporating the existing buildings and surrounding gardens &amp;amp; parklands as exhibition and gallery spaces. A dedicated gallery building (Heide III) was constructed in 1993 and the museum continued to broaden its collection of works to include all forms of contemporary Australian art, including some by contemporary Indigenous artists. The museum underwent major redevelopment in 2005-06 which included the installation of several sculptural and installation art pieces, landscaping &amp;amp; redesign of the gardens, construction of a new education centre &amp;amp; gallery space, extension of the Heide III building and various other works. In 2009 after 19 months of redevelopment, the cafe reopened in November as Cafe Vue at Heide. This completed building works at Heide.</description>

            <description>Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame, based in the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, Canada, commemorates and honours those whose accomplishments in aviation contributed so much to Canada's development as a nation. Founded in 1973, the Hall of Fame has honoured thus far more than 200 aviators, engineers, technicians and administrators. Due to its size and geographical location, Canada has had to rely upon aviation much more than other countries. With so much territory unsuitable for surface travel, it was up to aviation to unite the country and bring the distant regions the opportunities for social and economic progress that would make them part of Canada. The unique combination of pioneering aviation and pioneering development of the country resulted in many outstanding examples of heroism, skill, tenacity, courage, wisdom, and luck, and many great stories to be told. The best of these stories are described in the Aviation Hall of Fame. Stories are told on four by eight foot panels with portraits, citations, photographs, and memorabilia. The Hall has an extensive collection of personal items and memorabilia related to inducted members, including such material as licenses, logbooks, uniforms, insignia, medals, trophies and awards, documents, correspondence, scrapbooks and photographs. The reference library contains approximately 2,500 books and over 12,000 periodicals related specifically to Canadian aviation. Items are loaned to other museums in Canada for exhibit purposes, and may be accessed by researchers and visitors, by appointment. The Hall of Fame also awards the Belt of Orion each year at its annual induction dinner, to an organization notable for its contribution to Canadian aviation.</description>

            <address>1601 N. Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60614</address>
            <description>Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society) was founded in 1856. It is currently located in Lincoln Park in a building at the corner of Clark Street and North Avenue in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood of Lincoln Park in Chicago. It was renamed the Chicago History Museum in September, 2006 by then director Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch, who presumed that Chicagoans were too stupid to understand the original name. He dumbed-down many of the exhibits as well. Much of the early collection amassed by the museum was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but like the city, the museum rose from the ashes. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was the original Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln. After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in the Scammon Building until it, and their collection, were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on the site of its pre-1871 building. The replacement building opened in 1896 and, after housing the collection for thirty-six years, was used for many purposes and often remained vacant until being transformed into a nightclub in 1985. This impressively massive Romanesque building is currently the home of the Excalibur nightclub. In 1920, the Society purchased the large collection of Charles F. Gunther with the intention of changing its focus from a research institution to a more public museum. The current home of the Museum was constructed in 1932, by the WPA, to facilitate that aim. The original Federalist structure has been added on to twice, however both additions have been on the western side and the old facade remains on the park side. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house a research library which is open to the public.</description>

            <description>The Barnes Foundation is an educational art institution in Lower Merion Township, a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was founded in 1922 by Albert C. Barnes, who collected art after making a fortune by co-developing an early antimicrobial drug marketed as Argyrol. Today, the Foundation possesses more than 2500 objects, including 800 paintings estimated to be worth about $25 billion. Among its collection are 181 works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 69 by Paul Cézanne, 59 by Henri Matisse, 46 by Pablo Picasso, 21 by Chaim Soutine, 18 by Henri Rousseau, 16 by Amedeo Modigliani, 11 by Edgar Degas, 7 by Vincent Van Gogh, 6 by Georges Seurat, as well as numerous other masters, including Giorgio de Chirico, Paul Gauguin, El Greco, Francisco Goya, Edouard Manet, Jean Hugo, Claude Monet, Maurice Utrillo, William Glackens, Charles Demuth, Maurice Prendergast, and a variety of African artworks, ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art, and American and European decorative arts and metalwork. A notable aspect of the Barnes Foundation’s art collection is its display in “wall ensembles,” which are intentional combinations of works from different time periods, geographic areas, and styles for the purpose of comparison and study. The Foundation became embroiled in controversy due to a financial crisis in the 1990s, partially related to longstanding restrictions related to its location in a residential neighborhood. The relocation of the gallery from Lower Merion to a site in Philadelphia, on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, for enhanced public access is scheduled for 2012.</description>

            <name>American Visionary Art Museum</name>
            <address>United States</address>
            <description>The American Visionary Art Museum (AVAM) is an art museum located in the Federal Hill neighborhood at 800 Key Highway in Baltimore, Maryland. The city agreed to give the museum a piece of land on the south shore of the Inner Harbor under the condition that its organizers would clean up residual pollution from a copper paint factory and a whiskey warehouse that formerly occupied the site. It has been designated by Congress as America's national museum for self-taught art. The founder and director of the AVAM is Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, who while working in the development department of Sinai Hospital’s (Baltimore) People Encouraging People (a program geared toward aiding psychiatric patients in their return to the community) began to develop the idea for a visionary museum, an idea that eventually blossomed into the American Visionary Art Museum, or AVAM. Initially, Hoffberger was simply interested in the artwork created by the patients in the People Encouraging People program, and found herself “impressed with their imagination” and looking to “their strengths, not their illnesses. ” Hoffberger was greatly impressed by a 1980s visit to the Musee de l’Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland, which was established by French artist Jean Dubuffet as a collection of “l’art brut” or “raw art because of the untamed emotions resonating in it. ”8 Hoffberger described the museum as “the best, the most imaginative, the most original museum” and soon adopted the idea of “l’art brut” for her own visionary museum. To gauge the community’s interest in visionary art, Hoffberger and gallery owner George Ciscle held an exhibit in 1987 titled “American Outsider Art,” at which point she formally announced her plans for the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. With the support of her friends and family, Hoffberger petitioned the city of Baltimore and was eventually awarded two buildings near the city’s Inner Harbor worth $1.1 million. The State of Maryland also issued $1.3 million in bonds to finance the construction, which helped jump-start the building process. Hoffberger also relied heavily on contributions and donations, a tradition that continues to keep the museum running today. Hoffberger raised $7 million in six years from donors such as Anita Roddick. Designed by Rebecca Swanston and Alex Castro, the museum was opened to the public on November 24, 1995. AVAM has 55,000 square feet (5,100 m) of exhibit space and a permanent collection of approximately 4,000 pieces. The collection includes works by visionary artists Ho Baron, Nek Chand, Ted Gordon, Clyde Jones, Leo Sewell, Vollis Simpson and Ben Wilson as well as over 40 pieces from the Cabaret Mechanical Theatre of London. Some of this work is displayed in a gallery on the first floor of the Main Building, throughout the James Rouse Visionary Center, and outdoors when new temporary themed exhibitions are being installed. The museum has no staff curators, preferring to use guest curators for its shows. Rather than focusing shows on specific artists or styles, it sponsors themed exhibitions with titles such as Wind in Your Hair and High on Life. Hoffberger takes pride in the fact that AVAM is &quot;pretty un-museumy&quot; http://baltimorechronicle. com/wind_in_hair. html.</description>

            <description>The Roman-Germanic Museum is an important archaeological museum in Cologne, Germany. It has a large collection of Roman artifacts from the Roman settlement Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, on which modern Cologne is built. The museum protects the original place of a Roman town villa, of which the large Dionysus Mosaic remains in its original place in the basement now, and the related Roman Road just outside. In this respect the museum is an archaeological site. The museum also is the institution to preserve the Cologne Roman cultural heritage, and therefore preserves wonderful Roman glass from Roman funerals and burial. This archaeological function also includes the supervision of the Cologne underground, which is now under construction. Most of the museum's collection was formerly housed at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne until 1946. In the front of the museum the former northern town gate of Cologne with the inscription CCAA (for Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium) is shown.</description>

            <description>The Cobb and Co Museum is located in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. The museum was opened in 1987 when the Queensland Museum was looking for space to display its catalogue of horse drawn vehicles. Instead of taking up the huge amount of space required to display the collection properly at its Brisbane campus, the museum decided to open up a new campus in Toowoomba. In 2001, a second stage was built onto the existing museum to create a space to display the history of Toowoomba and the Darling Downs. This extension brought the entire museum space to over 2000 square metres. The refurbished Cobb &amp;amp; Co Museum also allowed space to house the Museum Resource Centre for Southern Queensland. The museum now houses over fifty horse drawn vehicles, including sturdy drays and farm wagons, that tell the story of European settlement on the Darling Downs, while sulkies and buggies demonstrate transportation imported to Australia during the 1880s. Elaborate Phaetons, Victoria and Landau carriages give a glimpse of the grandeur of times when life's pace was a little slower. The original Cobb and Co coaches, including the last coach which ran from Yuleba to Surat in 1924, are the pride of the collection. Both the museum's name and its location in Toowoomba rather than Brisbane, derive from the fact that Toowoomba was the first stop of the Cobb &amp;amp; Co coach service that ran in from the southern cities to Queensland from 1866 until 1924. The Cobb and Co Museum is part of the Queensland Heritage Trails Network and today is claimed to be home of Australia's finest collection of horse drawn vehicles.</description>

            <description>Seven Stories is a centre for children's literature in the United Kingdom and is based in the Ouseburn Valley, Newcastle upon Tyne, close to the city's newly regenerated quayside. The centre takes its name from the theory that there are only seven basic plots in literature, and the fact that the renovated Victorian mill in which it is housed has seven levels. Seven Stories is the first museum in the UK wholly dedicated to the art of British children’s books. It has a changing programme of exhibitions aimed at both children and adults. Recognised as a national home for children’s literature, Seven Stories brings together original manuscripts and illustrations from some of the nation's best loved children’s books, to involve visitors in an exploration of creativity, literature and art. Substantial original artwork and manuscripts has been donated to the centre and the collection continues to grow. Jacqueline Wilson, Terry Jones, Philip Pullman and Quentin Blake are among some of the centre's most distinguished patrons. Seven Stories liaises with local institutions such as Newcastle's Discovery Museum, where an exhibition celebrating the work of Miffy creator Dick Bruna has been held, and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne with which it jointly hosts a number of PhD studentships funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Many children's authors and illustrators visit the centre to run workshops and give talks, including David Almond, Catherine Rayner, Michael Foreman, Terry Deary, Judith Kerr and Jacqueline Wilson. Activities include dressing-up and dramatic fun, creative writing and wordplay, illustration and craft. The museum includes one of the largest independent, specialist children’s bookshops in Britain, with over 50,000 titles. Seven Stories opened in August 2005 and is the operating name of The Centre for Children's Books, a registered charity.</description>

            <description>The National Museum of Naval Aviation is a military and aerospace museum located at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. The museum opened in 1962. As its name suggests, the museum is devoted to the history of naval aviation, including that of the U. S. Navy, the U. S. Marine Corps, and the U. S. Coast Guard. More than 150 aircraft and spacecraft are on display, including four former Blue Angel A-4 Skyhawks (the Blue Angels are based at NAS Pensacola), the Curtis NC-4 (the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic), U. S. Coast Guard helicopters, biplanes, a K-47 Airship control gondola and tail fin, an aircraft that President George H. W. Bush trained in, and the S-3 Viking used to transport President George W. Bush to the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003. These historic and one-of-a-kind aircraft are displayed both inside the Museum's 300,000 square feet (30,000 m) of exhibit space and outside on the Museum's 37 acre grounds. In addition to the displays, the museum operates an IMAX theatre, museum store, and cafe. Also the museum is the home of the National Flight Academy, a 6-day program designed (in partnership with the Escambia and Santa Rosa school districts) to teach 7th through 12th grade students about the importance of science and math in aerospace careers. The Academy is currently planning a 245,000-square-foot (22,800 m) expansion to the museum which would add classroom and dormitory space for the students during their stay. The museum is open 9:00 am to 5:00 pm every day except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Parking and admission to the museum are free, though donations are welcome. Some exhibits inside the museum, such as the theatre, charge separate admission. Practice demonstrations by the Blue Angels may be viewed from the museum most Tuesday and Wednesday mornings between March and November. These practices are weather permitting, and a tentative practice schedule may be viewed on the Blue Angels’ website. Captain Robert L. Rasmussen, a retired Navy captain and Blue Angel, is the current director of the National Museum of Naval Aviation. He hand-sculpted many of the statues and painted many of the watercolor and oil paintings in the museum as well.</description>

            <description>Moderna museet, the Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm, Sweden, is a state museum located on the island of Skeppsholmen in central Stockholm, that was first opened in 1958. Its first manager was Pontus Hultén. It houses Swedish and international modern and contemporary art, including pieces by Picasso and Salvador Dalí and a model of the Tatlin Tower. The museum's restaurant is also famous on its own and popular due to its beautiful location. Visiting the permanent collection was originally free of charge, but some of the temporary exhibitions had entrance fees. The fees were reinstated in 2007. In 1993, six works by Picasso and two by Georges Braque totalling more than £40m were stolen from the museum in a renowned coup where the burglars came in through the roof by night, copying the method from the 1955 French movie Rififi . Only three of the Picasso paintings have been recovered. Between 1994 and 1998, the museum was temporarily moved while the building in Skeppsholmen was rebuilt by the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo. In 2005 it played host to the successful onedotzero festival bringing a new younger audience to the museum with screenings, installations, talks and live VJ audio-visual events. On May 2010, Daniel Birnbaum becomes the new director of the museum.</description>

            <description>The Butler Institute of American Art, located on Wick Avenue in Youngstown, Ohio, United States, was the first museum dedicated exclusively to American art. Established by local industrialist and philanthropist Joseph G. Butler, Jr. , the museum has been operating pro bono since 1919. Dedicated in 1919, the original structure is a McKim, Mead and White architectural masterpiece listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Prior to 2007, the most celebrated work in the Butler's permanent collection was Winslow Homer's Snap the Whip, a famed tribute to the era of the one-room schoolhouse. In 2007, however, the museum acquired the Norman Rockwell painting Lincoln the Railsplitter for $1.6 million. The previous owner of the 84.5 by 44.5 inch painting was businessman and former presidential candidate Ross Perot. Other aspects of the nation's past are captured in a unique collection of paintings featuring southwestern Native Americans, which were once part of Joseph Butler's personal collection. Additional highlights include an iconic depiction of George Washington's wedding, William Gropper's celebrated Youngstown Strike, an interpretation of the area's violent 1937 Little Steel Strike, and Albert Bierstadt's 'Oregon Trail, 1869. Meanwhile, the gallery of modern art features a striking, life-sized painting by Alfred Leslie titled, Americans: Youngstown, Ohio, which depicts personalities connected to the Butler as they appeared in the 1970s.</description>

            <name>Singapore Art Museum</name>
            <address>71 Bras Basah Road</address>
            <description>The Singapore Art Museum (SAM) houses the national art collection of Singapore, possesses an impressive collection of 7750 pieces of Singaporean and Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art, and currently nurtures an expanding collection of New Asian and International Contemporary Art. It is one of the first art museums with international standard museum facilities and programmes in Southeast Asia and joins a league of new generation museums around the world with well-executed exhibitions and meaningful community outreach programmes Situated in the centre of Singapore’s major shopping district and Waterloo Street Arts Belt, SAM is located alongside Singapore’s major performing arts and visual arts institutions: such as the Nanyang Academy of Fine Art, LaSalle College of the Arts, the Stamford Arts Centre, the Selegie Arts Centre, Singapore Calligraphy Centre, YMS Arts Centre, Dance Ensemble Singapore, Sculpture Square and Action Theatre as well as the School of the Arts: an institution that offers an integrated arts and academic curriculum for youths aged 13 to 18 years of age. SAM is accessible by major public transportation systems such as the public buses, the MRT lines and cab services. Bras Basah MRT line, scheduled to open in 2010, will literally bring visitors right to SAM’s doorstep. The museum, then known as the Fine Arts Museum was borne out of a project by the National Museum to set up of a five-museum precinct in the city. The other 4 museums that make up the precinct are known as the Singapore History Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, People's Museum and the Children's Museum. The Fine Arts Museum project began with the restoration of the former St. Joseph's Institution building. At the same time, the appointment of artist and surgeon Dr Earl Lu to head an 11-member Fine Arts Museum Board was announced on July 18, 1992, by the Minister of State (Information and the Arts and Education) Dr Ker Sin Tze. The 11-men Board was tasked to acquire works of art by notable painters from Southeast Asia and East Asia, and by upcoming potential artists from these regions, for the benefit of the visual arts heritage of Singaporeans in centuries to come. Low Chuck Tiew, a retired banker and prominent art collector, served as museum adviser, along with Mrs Shirley Loo-Lim, Deputy Director of the National Museum as vice-Chairman of the Board. Dr Geh Min, Dr Ho Kok Hoe, Mr Lee Seng Tee, Dr Arthur Lim, T. K. Sabapathy, Sarkasi Said, Sum Yoke Kit, Wee Chwee Heng, and Dr Yap-Whang Whee Yong formed the rest of the Museum Board. The restoration work on the 140-year-old national monument took more than two years and a cost of S$30 million. It first opened its doors to the public as the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) on October 20, 1995. Its first art installation is a S$90,000 7-m-high Swarovski crystal chandelier at the Museum main entrance, which weighs 325 kilograms and took over three months to make. The Museum was officially opened by then-Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Goh Chok Tong on January 20, 1996. In his opening speech he envisioned the new museum, along with the other four museums in the Arts and Heritage District and the Arts Centre, aiding Singapore in reprising its historic role as a centre of entrepot trade for the arts, culture, civilisation and ideas to the people in the Asian region and the rest of the world. SAM’s galleries feature paintings, sculptures, and installations from its permanent collection of Singapore and Southeast Asian modern and contemporary art as well as touring renowned shows like the Masterpieces from the Guggenheim Museum: Scientist, Inventor, Artist. Taking over from the functions of the National Museum Art Gallery which was opened in 1976 with 93 artworks, its collection includes works from major local artists such as Georgette Chen, Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Lim Tze Peng and Huang Yao. From 2001, the museum began acquiring works and accepting donations from around the region, including from regional artists like Affandi, Hendra Gunawan, Pratuang Emjaroen, Montien Boonma, Le Pho and Bui Xuan Phai. The museum has hosted a series of travelling exhibitions since its opening, including those featuring works by Liu Kang, Leonardo Da Vinci, Chen Chong Swee, Fan Chang Tien, Lim Tze Peng and Chen Wen Hsi. Community outreach continues to be an important area of the Museum's function through the promotion of awareness and appreciation of art within the local and regional context. It encourages the growth of an active and stimulating cultural environment in Singapore. This is done not only through the Museum's exhibition programmes but also through its education and public programmes which cover a diversity of art trends and practices, fringe activities and public lectures, aimed at reaching the local community at large as well as regional and international visitors to Singapore. Visitors to the SAM can expect to find an interactive, living centre for art, with advanced museum facilities. Since its opening, the Museum has been stimulating the cultural environment of Singapore and continues to do so with breathtaking shows and exciting programmes.</description>

            <name>Atlas Computer Laboratory</name>
            <address>Chilton, Oxfordshire</address>
            <description>The Atlas Computer Laboratory on the Chilton, Oxfordshire campus shared by the Harwell Laboratory was one of the major computer laboratories in the world, which operated between 1961 and 1975 to provide a service to British scientists at a time when powerful computers were not usually available. The main user population was the UK Universities and some government agencies. From 1964 to 1971 the laboratory housed the largest of the three examples of the Ferranti Atlas 1 computer that was purchased for £2.5 million, and after which the laboratory was named. For a time, it was the fastest and most innovative of the computers available worldwide. Throughout its life it was headed by Jack Howlett. Early staff or visitors included A. O. L. Atkin (1964-1970), I. J. Good (1964-1967), and Donald Michie who had worked together at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. High quality text and graphics output on both paper and film was provided by a Stromberg-Carlson SC4020 microfilm recorder that provided a unique service for many years, especially to people interested in doing computer animation. Associated with the SC4020 was a PDP15 satellite computer that provided previewing facilities for the SC4020 and a range of interactive graphics facilities for users. From 1971 an ICL 1906A was installed with twice the computing power of the Atlas 1. About the same time, work started on replacing the ageing SC4020 with a modern III FR80 microfilm recorder which expanded the range of output media to include microfiche and was able to generate colour as well as black and white output. From 1967 until 1985 several of the earliest computed generated image (CGI) or computer animated films were produced at the laboratory, particularly for the Open University. Most famously, the laboratory's facilities were used to produce the raster wireframe model rendering shown on the navigation monitors in the landing sequence of the Ridley Scott film Alien which won the 1979 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The Atlas Computer Laboratory made important contributions to systems software including operating systems, compilers, computer graphics, and networking. Basic software in the areas of statistics, mathematics, linguistics, chemistry and many other areas was also developed . In 1975 the Atlas Computer Laboratory was closed, moving some parts to the Daresbury Laboratory and amalgamating the rest with the neighbouring Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, and then in 1979 with the Appleton Laboratory to form the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Since 2007 the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory has been operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The STFC has announced that the building that was originally constructed for the Atlas Computer Laboratory will be updated to house the first European Space Agency Centre in the UK, to be opened in July 2009 .</description>

            <description>The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) is a Smithsonian Institution museum established in 2003. It will be built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.. In 2006, the Smithsonian's Board of Regents selected a 5 acres (2.0 ha) site near the grounds of the Washington Monument and the National Museum of American History. The boundaries of the site are Constitution Avenue on the north, Madison Drive on the south, 14th Street, NW on the east, and 15th Street, NW on the west. Construction is expected to begin in 2012. The museum was established on December 19, 2003, through federal legislation. Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch was selected as the museum's first director in July 2005. In 2007 the National Museum of African American History and Culture became the first major museum to open on the Web before completing a physical structure. The website includes the museum's first exhibit, mounted in New York. It is also designed to encourage collaboration between scholars and the public. The museum is slated to be finished by 2015. The main feature of the web-based initiative is the Memory Book application, which allows individuals to contribute to the website via pictures, a story, or audio application, to spotlight unique experiences in African-American culture. Physical exhibits will also be mounted in other institutions of the Smithsonian as well as in museums outside of Washington pending completion of the museum's new building.</description>

            <description>The Mid-Hudson Children's Museum is located on North Water Street in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. It has been located in a brick building across from the former Innis Dye Works building, a short walk from the Poughkeepsie station on Metro-North's Hudson Line and right on the Hudson River. It has been there since 2002, five years after its 1997 founding. Before then it had been located in the South Hills Mall. Its mission is &quot;enlighten minds through a fun and creative learning environment where hands-on experiences spark curiosity, discovery and the joy of exploration&quot;. All exhibits are hands-on, including a play-space model of the human heart, a Hudson River tides water table and models of Leonardo da Vinci's machine. Sponsors include IBM, a major local employer, Texaco and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Representative Maurice Hinchey secured a $200,000 grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services to facilitate the sharing of exhibits between the children's museum and the American Museum of Natural History. In 2007 the museum acquired the Pavilion, an 8,000-square-foot (740 m) open-air building nearby. It will host exhibits showing life in the Hudson Valley over different periods of time, stretching back to prehistory. These are scheduled to be open in summer 2009.</description>

            <description>The Dock Museum is situated in the town of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. Its exhibits are largely based around the history of the town, heavily focusing on the shipbuilding industry at VSEL, the steelworks industry — of which Barrow once had the world's largest and the World War II bombings on the town. There has been a museum in Barrow since 1907 and in its current location since 1994, when 50,000 people visited it in its first year, visitor numbers peaked at 120,000 in 2001. The museum has free entry, and is one of the Lake District's top attractions.</description>

            <description>The Francis Winspear Centre for Music is a performing arts centre located in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Built in 1997, it is the home of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. The center is named after Dr. Francis G. Winspear, who donated $6 million to the construction of the facility - the single largest private donation to a performing arts facility in Canadian history. The Canadian federal government contributed $15 million and the Alberta government contributed $15 million as well. In 2002, the Davis Concert Organ was installed at the Centre. Launched at a sold-out performance on September 14, 2002, the pipe organ was built by Orgues Létourneau Limitée of St. Hyacinthe, Québec. It features 96 stops, 122 ranks, and 6,551 pipes. It is named after Dr. Stuart Davis, to acknowledge his generosity and also in memory of his late wife Winona. The concert hall itself has a seating capacity of 1,716 people and when seating is available in the choir loft above the main stage area the hall can hold up to 1,932, and is a tall, rectangular room with stepped, curved balconies and terraces. With its parallel side walls, the Winspear represents a modern adaptation of the classic &quot;shoebox&quot; shaped concert halls of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</description>

            <description>(&quot;New Museum&quot;) is a museum in Berlin, Germany, located to the north of the Altes Museum (Old Museum) on Museum Island. It was built between 1843 and 1855 according to plans by Friedrich August Stüler, a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The museum was closed at the beginning of World War II in 1939, and was heavily damaged during the bombing of Berlin. The rebuilding was overseen by the English architect David Chipperfield. The museum officially reopened in October 2009 and received a 2010 RIBA European Award for its architecture. Exhibits include the Egyptian and Prehistory and Early History collections, as it did before the war. The artifacts it houses include the iconic bust of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Both as a part of the Museum Island complex, and as an individual building, the museum testifies to the neoclassical architecture of museums in the 19th century. With its new industrialized building procedures and its use of iron construction, the museum plays an important role in the history of technology. Since the classical and ornate interiors of the Glyptothek and of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich were destroyed in World War II, the partly destroyed interior of the Neues Museum ranks among the last remaining examples of interior museum layout of this period in Germany.</description>

            <description>The Fort de l'Île Sainte-Hélène, an historic site on Saint Helen's Island that belongs to the city of Montreal, Quebec, was constructed in the early 1820s as an arsenal in the defensive chain of forts built to protect Canada from a threat of American invasion. Although not heavily fortified, it served an important purpose as the central artillery depot for all forts west. These included Fort Henry and Fort Lennox. The red stone used to build the Fort is a breccia quarried on the island, which is situated in the St. Lawrence River between the island of Montreal and the south shore. The Levis Tower, contrary to popular belief, was not part of the fortifications on the island. It was built in the 1930s to house a water tower..</description>

            <description>The Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology began in 1966 as the Museum of Man, at the bequest and initiation of Dr. Lowell Holmes, Professor of Anthropology at Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Over the next 33 years it grew slowly and became known throughout the campus as a small but interesting museum. The collections and exhibitions include cultural items from around the world and archaeological objects predominantly from the American Midwest and Southwest. In 1999, the anthropology department and the museum moved to a new location in Neff Hall. The museum was expanded and Mr. Jerry Martin was hired as Director. This was the first time that the museum had a professional director whose only job was to work with, and develop the museum. Martin’s concept was to have the museum essentially run and operated by students as part of their museum studies training. He raised funds to hire student staff to run the day-to-day operations of the museum under his supervision. As of the fall semester of 2006, the museum has the funds to hire five student positions. The museum has a wide range of functions. It has exhibitions open to the public, houses a rapidly expanding collection, a support unit for the anthropology department and faculty of Wichita State University, a research facility for students, a repository for United States Government archaeological collections, and the basis for a growing museum studies program. These different functions provide a very wide range of experience for the student staff.</description>

It is Canada's first permanent creation museum. The museum measures 900 square feet (84 m), cost C$280,000 to build, and was opened on June 5, 2007 by owner Harry Nibourg, an oil field service worker. It hosts 40 to 80 visitors weekly. Exhibits include an interactive display of the creationist claims about the bacterium flagellum, trace the ancestry of the British royal family to Adam and Eve, and present fossils as evidence for the flood of Noah. It has been compared to the larger and more controversial Creation Museum in Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky, which opened earlier the same year.

            <description>Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park is a complex of historic sites on the Siksika 146 Indian reserve in Alberta, Canada. This crossing of the Bow River was traditionally a bison-hunting and gathering place for the Siksika people and their allies in the Blackfoot Confederacy. Nearby are the remains of an ancient earthlodge village, believed to have been built by people from the Upper Mississippi valley in what is now the United States. It is unique in being an example of a permanent village on the plains: an area associated with nomadic hunting. The crossing became an important place in Canadian history when Treaty 7 was signed here between the native nations of what is now southern Alberta and the Canadian government on behalf of the Crown in 1877. It was also here that Crowfoot, chief of the Siksika, is believed to have died and been buried. As well, Poundmaker, a chief of the Cree who had been ceremonially adopted by Crowfoot in order to create peace between the Blackfoot and the Cree, was also buried here until being moved in 1967. In 1925 the traditional gathering site and the treaty signing site were declared National Historic Sites of Canada by the federal government's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. In 1972, the earthlodge village was also declared a national historic site. In 1977, Prince Charles visited the site to help commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the treaty. After the success of this event the Siksika council wanted to build the site into a historical and tourist attraction and began fundraising and planning. In 2007 the historical park opened, which includes an interpretive centre, monuments to Poundmaker, Crowfoot, and Treaty 7, tipi remains, and hiking trails, and the earthlodge village site believed to have been built by Mandan people in the mid-18th century. The nearest towns are Cluny and Gleichen, in Wheatland County.</description>

The museum is within the Valley Life Sciences Building (VLSB), designed by Arthur Brown Jr. Its collections are primarily intended for research and are thus not accessible to the public. A limited number of fossils from the collection is on display in the VLSB. Although located on the Berkeley campus, the museum is the primary locality for storing fossils collected statewide. The original fossils, around which the current collection has grown, were those gathered as part of the California Geological Survey from 1860-1867.</description>

            <description>The Yūshūkan is a Japanese military and war museum located within Yasukuni Shrine in Chiyoda, Tokyo. As a museum maintained by the shrine, which is dedicated to the souls of soldiers who died fighting on behalf of the Emperor of Japan, the museum contains various artifacts and documents concerning Japanese war casualties and military activity from the start of the Meiji Restoration to the end of the Pacific War. The museum was established in 1882, and describes itself as the first and oldest war and military museum in Japan. The museum has been accused of containing revisionism in its accounts of Japan's actions in World War II, as well as glorifying Japan's aggressive militaristic past. See Controversies surrounding Yasukuni Shrine for the full discussion of these controversies.</description>

            <description>The James A. Michener Art Museum is a museum in Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Founded in 1988 and named for the Pulitzer Prize–winning writer James A. Michener, the museum is dedicated to preserving, interpreting and exhibiting the art and cultural heritage of the Bucks County region. Its Pennsylvania Impressionism collection contains works from the Impressionistic art colony centered in New Hope during the early 20th century. The idea of a museum in Doylestown dedicated to the works of the Pennsylvania Impressionists dates to 1949, when local artist Walter Emerson Baum founded an informal committee with himself, Bucks County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Charles H. Boehm, and The Daily Intelligencer editor George Hotchkiss to explore the possibilities of the establishment of such an institution.</description>

A registered charity, it is also a designated museum under the terms of the National Heritage Act 1983 and an executive non-departmental public body by virtue of receiving Grant-in-Aid from the Ministry of Defence.

Highlights of the Museum include the Medal Room, with over 8000 medals on show (including all 10 Victoria Crosses awarded to the Corps) and, as of June 2008, The Making of the Royal Marines Commando exhibition, a major display highlighting the demands of the 32-week training course undertaken by all Royal Marines recruits. In September 2008, the Museum successfully purchased a rare medal for £41,000 (thanks to a contribution of £28,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund); the Naval General Service Medal with Trafalgar clasp was awarded to Lt Lewis Buckle Reeve who, following serious injury at the Battle of Trafalgar, was laid next to the mortally-wounded Nelson on board HMS Victory. This medal is now on show alongside Lt Reeve's Muster List of Royal Marines on-board HMS Victory at Trafalgar. On the 28th of October 2008 - The Museum's 50th birthday - the Royal Marines Museum won the Best Small Visitor Attraction of the Year award from Tourism South East, recognising its excellence, both in terms of exhibitions and the quality of the customer service provided.

            <address>Long Street, Devizes, Wiltshire, England</address>
            <description>The Wiltshire Heritage Museum, formerly known as Devizes Museum, is a museum, library and art gallery in Devizes, Wiltshire, England. The museum was established and is still run by, the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society (WANHS), a registered charity founded in 1853. After the purchase of an old grammar school the museum was opened in 1873. Subsequently it expanded into two Georgian houses on either side and still occupies this location today. The museum maintains a collection covering the archaeology, art, history and natural history of Wiltshire. This collection covers periods of history from as far back as the Neolithic and also includes Bronze Age, Roman, Saxon, Mediaeval and more recent historical artefacts. Among the prehistoric collections are items from the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site. Several of the collections have been designated as being a significant part of England’s cultural heritage. One of the most important collections at the museum is the finds from Bush Barrow, a Bronze Age burial mound in Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The barrow was excavated by William Cunnington in 1808 and produced the richest and most important finds from a Bronze Age grave in the Stonehenge Landscape to date. The finds were acquired by the museum in 1883 and were displayed there until 1922 when they were indefinitely loaned to the British Museum. After a controversial restoration of the largest piece that may not reflect its original finish, the pieces were returned to Devizes in 1985. Replicas are on permanent display in the museum but the original artefacts themselves are kept in a bank vault due to their priceless nature. The original pieces were exhibited for a weekend in 2008 to celebrate the bicentenary of their discovery. The Museum is currently raising funds to be able to create new Neolithic and Bronze Age displays, that will include the Bronze Age gold. English Heritage have announced that they are working in partnership with Wiltshire Heritage Museum and Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum in the development of the new Stonehenge Visitor Centre. The natural history collection includes remains of a plesiosaur called Bathyspondylus found at Swindon in 1774. Bathyspondylus swindoniensis was first described in 1982 from the Museum's specimens.</description>

            <description>The Historical Archive of the City of Cologne is the municipal archive of Cologne, Germany. It ranks among the largest communal archives in Europe. A municipal archive has been taking custody of records in Cologne since the Middle Ages. The oldest inventory of charters in the archive is dated 1408/1409. The oldest document kept in the archive is a charter dated 922 AD. The archive contains official records and private documents from all ages of Cologne history, as well as an extensive library of manuscripts. While the adjective &quot;historical&quot; in its name might suggest a closed, complete archive with a focus on older history, the archive is also the official government repository that is collecting the most recent municipal archival records. The six-story archive building collapsed on 3 March 2009, along with two neighboring apartment buildings. Two residents of neighboring buildings were found dead. All archive staff and visiting archive users survived, as they could escape after a warning by construction workers. The actual degree of damage to the historical treasures kept in the building is still unknown. A substantial part of the written records of the city's history is believed to have been destroyed.</description>

            <description>The Zabriskie Gallery was started in New York City by Virginia Zabriskie in 1954. She took over the art gallery with a one-dollar down payment. It had been the Korman Gallery, a cooperative that included the painters Pat Adams and Clinton Hill. By the 1980s, Zabriskie had two galleries in New York (one for painting and one for sculpture) and another in Paris. The Paris gallery focused on photography and allowed for a &quot;lively exchange&quot; between American and French artists during the 1980s and 1990s. She was honored in 1999 with the Medaille de la Ville de Paris. Artists who have exhibited in the Zabriskie Gallery include Abraham Walkowitz (Zabriskie held his correspondence and papers, and donated them to the University of Delaware). Zabriskie was a supporter of the work of Elie Nadelman and is credited with &quot;rescuing her from neglect. &quot; Pat Adams held her first solo show there, and her 2005 exhibition Pat Adams Paintings 1954-2004, held in early 2004 at the Zabriskie Gallery, cemented Adams's reputation as &quot;one of the most important abstract painters.&quot;</description>

            <description>The Natural History Museum is one of three large museums on Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London, England (the others are the Science Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum). Its main frontage is on Cromwell Road. The museum is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 70 million items within five main collections: Botany, Entomology, Mineralogy, Palaeontology and Zoology. The museum is a world-renowned centre of research, specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Darwin. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments. Access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons, and ornate architecture — sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature — both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast which dominates the vaulted central hall. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881, and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.</description>

            <description>The Musée du Louvre, or officially Grand Louvre — in English the Louvre Museum or simply the Louvre — is one of the the world's largest museums, the most visited art museum in the world and a historic monument. It is a central landmark of Paris and located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the 1st arrondissement (district). Nearly 35,000 objects from prehistory to the 19th century are exhibited over an area of 60,600 square metres (652,300 square feet). The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) which began as a fortress built in the late 12th century under Philip II. Remnants of the fortress are still visible. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of antique sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum, to display the nation's masterpieces. The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being confiscated church and royal property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The size of the collection increased under Napoleon when the museum was renamed the Musée Napoléon. After his defeat at Waterloo, many works seized by Napoleon's armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and gifts since the Third Republic, except during the two World Wars. As of 2008, the collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.</description>

            <name>Metropolitan Museum of Art</name>
            <address>5th Avenue and 82nd Street, Manhattan, New York</address>
            <description>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, known colloquially as The Met, is an art museum located on the eastern edge of Central Park, along what is known as Museum Mile in New York City, USA. Its permanent collection contains more than two million works of art, divided into nineteen curatorial departments. The main building, often referred to simply as &quot;the Met&quot;, is one of the world's largest art galleries; there is also a much smaller second location in Upper Manhattan, at &quot;The Cloisters&quot;, which features medieval art. Represented in the permanent collection are works of art from classical antiquity and Ancient Egypt, paintings and sculptures from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of American and modern art. The Met also maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanic, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is also home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes and accessories, and antique weapons and armor from around the world. A number of notable interiors, ranging from 1st century Rome through modern American design, are permanently installed in the Met's galleries. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 by a group of American citizens. The founders included businessmen and financiers, as well as leading artists and thinkers of the day, who wanted to open a museum to bring art and art education to the American people. It opened on February 20, 1872, and was originally located at 681 Fifth Avenue. As of 2007, the Met measures almost ⁄4-mile (400 m) long and occupies more than 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m).</description>

It holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1915, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography, and is probably best known for its extensive collection of impressionist and post-impressionist masterpieces (the largest in the world) by such painters such as Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Gauguin and Van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986.</description>

It is now a Grade I listed building. The museum was founded by two antique collectors, an American, Dallas Pratt (August 21, 1914 – May 20, 1994) and a Briton, John Judkyn (1913 – July 27, 1963) and opened to the public for the first time on July 1, 1961. The exhibits cover every period of American history. Because John Judkyn was a peace-loving Quaker, the museum contains no militaria. Included are 200 quilts and coverlets, and several pieces of Shaker furniture.</description>

            <description>Tate Liverpool is an art gallery and museum in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, and part of Tate, along with Tate St Ives, Cornwall, Tate Britain, London, and Tate Modern, London. The museum was an initiative of the Merseyside Development Corporation. Tate Liverpool was created to display work from the Tate Collection which comprises the national collection of British art from the year 1500 to the present day, and international modern art. The gallery also has a programme of temporary exhibitions. For a time it was the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art in the UK outside of London. The gallery opened in 1988 and is housed in a converted warehouse within the Albert Dock on Liverpool's waterfront. The original conversion was done by James Stirling but the building was given a major refurbishment in 1998 to create additional gallery space. In 2007, the foyer area was redesigned by architects Arca to create an updated appearance and better proportions, as well as to improve visitor handling. The centrepiece of the space is a new timber desk with an undulating orange fascia, which links to the retained colour scheme of the original conversion work by Stirling. A colour-changing wall acts as a backdrop to the simplified brick volume, visible from across Albert Dock. Behind the scenes, the architects also made alterations to the hospitality, cloakroom, events and education areas.</description>

            <name>National Motor Museum, Beaulieu</name>
            <address>Beaulieu, Hampshire, England</address>
            <description>The National Motor Museum (originally the Montagu Motor Museum) is a museum in the village of Beaulieu, set in the heart of the New Forest, in the English county of Hampshire. It was founded in 1952 by Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu as a tribute to his father, who was one of the great pioneers of motoring in the United Kingdom, being the first person to drive a motor car into the yard of the Houses of Parliament, and having introduced King Edward VII to motoring during the 1890s. At first the museum consisted of just five cars and a small collection of automobilia displayed in the front hall of Lord Montagu's ancestral home, Palace House, but such was the popularity of this small display that the collection soon outgrew its home and was transferred to wooden sheds in the grounds of the house. The reputation and popularity of the Beaulieu collection continued to grow: during 1959 the museum's &quot;attendance figures&quot; reached 296,909. By 1964 annual attendance exceeded half a million and a decision was taken to create a purpose built museum building in the grounds of the Beaulieu estate. A design committee chaired by the distinguished polymath-artist Sir Hugh Casson was created to drive the project, and the architect Leonard Manasseh was given the contract for the design of the building. By 1972, the collection exceeded 300 exhibits. In a ceremony performed by the Duke of Kent the new purpose-built museum building in the parkland surrounding Palace House was opened on 4 July 1972: the name was changed to the National Motor Museum, reflecting a change of status from a private collection to a charitable trust and highlighting Montagu's stated aim to provide Britain with a National Motor Museum &quot;worthy of the great achievements of its motor industry&quot;. The opening of the museum coincided with the UK launch of the Jaguar XJ12 which made it an appropriate week for celebrating the UK motor industry. The museum is run by the National Motor Museum Trust Ltd, a registered charity. An unusual feature of the new museum building in 1972 was a monorail passing through the interior of the building. Today, in addition to around 250 of the most historically important motor vehicles to have been produced since the late-19th century, including four world land speed record holders, the museum is also home to one of the finest collections of motoring books, journals, photographs, films, and automobilia in the world and is affiliated to the British Motorcycle Charitable Trust. Among its exhibits are Land Speed Record holders: Malcolm Campbell's 1925 350HP Sunbeam, Henry Segrave's 1927 Sunbeam 1000 hp and 1929 Golden Arrow, Donald Campbell's Bluebird CN7. The yellow Reliant Regal van from the BBC 1 TV comedy Only Fools And Horses, the Mini driven by Mr. Bean in the live-action series and a display of James Bond vehicles are also among the exhibits. The museum's latest exhibition is World of Top Gear, displaying the actual cars created by Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May for some of their most ambitious challenges on the TV show over the years. Additional attractions include a monorail, veteran bus ride, rally-car simulator ride, go-karting rink, playground, restaurant and a substantial part of the Palace House and grounds, including the partially ruined Beaulieu Abbey, providing a full day out. Among the monastery buildings to have been preserved are the domus (now used for functions and exhibitions), and the refectory, which is now the parish church. The museum is open every day except for Christmas Day, though inevitably it attracts its highest number of visitors during the summer months. In the summer, the New Forest Tour open-top bus route serves the museum.</description>

            <address>Paseo del Prado, Madrid, Spain</address>
            <description>The Museo del Prado is a museum and art gallery located in Madrid, the capital of Spain. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, from the 12th century to the early 19th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture, it also contains important collections of more than 5,000 drawings, 2,000 prints, 1,000 coins and medals, and almost 2,000 decorative objects and works of art. Sculpture is represented by more than 700 works and by a smaller number of sculptural fragments. The painting collection comprises about 7,800 paintings, of which only about 1,300 are at public display, mainly because of the museum's lack of space. A new, recently opened wing enlarged the display area by about 400 paintings, and it is currently used mainly for temporary expositions. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and it is considered to be among the greatest museums of art. The collection currently comprises around 7,600 paintings, 1,000 sculptures, 4,800 prints and 8,200 drawings, in addition to a large number of works of art and historic documents. At the present time, the Museum is displaying less than 1000 works in the main building, while around 3,100 works are on temporary loan to various museums and official institutions. The remainder are in storage. The best known work on display at the museum is Las Meninas by Velázquez. Velázquez not only provided the Prado with his own works, but his keen eye and sensibility was also responsible for bringing much of the museum's fine collection of Italian masters to Spain. Pablo Picasso's renowned work Guernica was exhibited in the Prado upon its return to Spain after the restoration of democracy, but was moved to the Museo Reina Sofía in 1992 as part of a transfer of all works later than the early 19th century to other buildings for space reasons.</description>

            <address>Gatineau, Quebec</address>
            <description>The Canadian Museum of Civilization is Canada's national museum of human history and the most popular and most-visited museum in Canada. It is located in Gatineau (in the area that was formerly known as Hull), Quebec, directly across the Ottawa River from Canada's Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. The Museum's primary purpose is to collect, study, preserve, and present material objects that illuminate the human history of Canada and the cultural diversity of its people. For the visiting public, the Museum of Civilization is most renowned for its permanent galleries, which explore Canada's 20,000 years of human history, and for its architecture and stunning riverside setting. The Museum also presents an ever-changing program of special exhibitions that expand on Canadian themes and explore other cultures and civilizations, past and present. The Museum of Civilization is also a major research institution. Its professional staff includes leading experts in Canadian history, archaeology, ethnology, folk culture, and more. With roots stretching back to 1856, the Museum is one of North America's oldest cultural institutions. It is also home to the Canadian Children's Museum, the Canadian Postal Museum, and an IMAX Theatre with 3D capacity. The Museum of Civilization is managed by the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, a federal Crown Corporation that is also responsible for the Canadian War Museum, the Children's and Postal Museums, and the Virtual Museum of New France. The Museum is accredited by the American Association of Museums (AAM) and a member of the Canadian Museums Association. Some 400 members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada at the Museum were on strike from 21 September to 16 December 2009. The labour dispute was resolved through face-to-face negotiations. The Museum of Civilization hosts a number of events year-round. The National Capital Commission’s Winterlude 2010 was launched on February 5 at the Museum with concerts, DJs, fireworks and live performances. The event was attended by an estimated 10,000 people. Canada Day celebrations included a citizenship ceremony, live entertainment and activities, workshops and an exclusive view of the fireworks, which brought more than 18,000 visitors to the Museum.</description>

The museum's focus on the work of southwestern Pennsylvania artists prompted famed art historian William H. Gerdts to write in his 1998 book Art Across America that the Westmoreland &quot;pioneered regional investigations. &quot; Significant artists represented in the museum's permanent collection include Mary Cassatt, William Merritt Chase, Colin Campbell Cooper, John Singleton Copley, Stuart Davis, Thomas Eakins, William Harnett, Childe Hassam, Robert Henri, Winslow Homer, George Luks, Paul Manship, John Singer Sargent, and Gilbert Stuart.</description>

            <description>The Musée Rodin in Paris, France, is a museum that was opened in 1919 in the Hôtel Biron and surrounding grounds. It displays works by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Rodin used the Hôtel Biron as his residence from 1908, and subsequently donated his entire collection of sculptures (along with paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Pierre-Auguste Renoir that he had acquired) to the French State on the condition that they turn the building into a museum dedicated to his works. The Musée Rodin contains most of Rodin's significant creations, including The Thinker, The Kiss and The Gates of Hell. Many of his sculptures are displayed in the museum's extensive garden. The museum is one of the most accessible museums in Paris. It is located near a Metro stop, Varenne, in a central neighborhood and the entrance fee is very reasonable. The gardens around the museum building contain many of the famous sculptures in natural settings. Behind the museum building is a small lake and casual restaurant. Additionally, the Metro stop, Varenne, features some of Rodin's sculptures on the platform. The building is served by Métro (line 13) : Varenne or Invalides, R.E. R (line C) : Invalides and Bus : 69, 82, 87, 92. The museum has also a room dedicated to works of Camille Claudel. Some paintings by Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh which were in Rodin's personal collections are also presented.</description>

            <address>Cleveland, Ohio, United States</address>
            <description>The Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, better known by its acronym, MOCA, is a contemporary art museum located in Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 1968 by Marjorie Talalay, Agnes Gund, and Nina Castelli Sundell as The New Gallery, the museum was renamed the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art in 1984. In order to expand its exhibition space, in 1990 the museum moved to its present location, a 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m) former Sears store r on Carnegie Avenue that is now part of the Cleveland Play House complex which was renovated by Richard Fleischman + Partners Architects, Inc. to retro-fit the space. In 2002, CCCA changed its name to Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. Works by such artists as Andy Warhol, Christo, and Claes Oldenburg are regularly shown, and past exhibits have featured art by Jim Hodges and Hildur Ásgeirsdóttir Jónsson, among others. The museum places a special focus on artists from Greater Cleveland and the rest of Northeastern Ohio. During the course of its three annual exhibition seasons, MOCA presents works by emerging local artists through the PULSE series, and works by local female artists under 30 through the Wendy L. Moore Emerging Artist Series. In December 2005, MOCA announced that it had received a $2.1 million grant from the George Gund Foundation to help fund a capital campaign to build a new museum in University Circle.</description>

Holdings of paintings from the Netherlands, French and Italian works, and contemporary art are particularly strong, with sculpture prominent throughout. Admission to the museum is free, although a $4 donation is recommended. The museum presently receives around 180,000 visitors per year and is supported entirely by donations, endowments, grants, ticket sales, and memberships.</description>

            <name>Frye Art Museum</name>
            <address>Seattle, WA 98104</address>
            <description>The Frye Art Museum is an art museum located in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, USA . The museum emphasizes painting and sculpture from the nineteenth century to the present. Its holdings originate in the private collection of Charles (1858–1940) and Emma (d. 1934) Frye. Charles, owner of a local meatpacking plant, set aside money in his will for a museum to house the Fryes' collection of over 230 paintings. The Frye Museum opened to the public in 1952, and was Seattle's first free art museum. The museum building was originally designed by Paul Thiry, although it has since been considerably altered. Charles Frye's will required that the majority of the Fryes' own collection continue always to be on view in rooms of a certain size; stipulations were also made about lighting conditions and specifically cement floors (ultimately elided by placing wood over the cement). He also required that admission always be free. These conditions were enough to keep the Seattle Art Museum from being interested in his collection. The Fryes' collection consisted entirely of representational works, with a tendency toward &quot;the dark, the dramatic, and the psychological&quot; rather than &quot;the genteel&quot;. The museum's permanent collection reflects Charles Frye's relatively conservative artistic tastes, and (despite the lack of any such stipulation in the will) the museum continued to be dedicated exclusively to representational art, both in its acquisitions and its exhibits. This conservatism reflected the artistic and social values of its first director, Walser Greathouse (d. 1966) and of his even more conservative widow and successor Ida Kay Greathouse, who ran the museum until 1993. However, exhibits under new, professional management in recent years have been far more venturesome, eliciting comparisons to Seattle's Henry Art Gallery. Exhibits in recent years have included &quot;Wondertoonel,&quot; an exhibit of Mark Ryden's often morbid images of childhood, &quot;The Retrofuturistic Universe of NSK&quot; (2005), and &quot;Henry Darger: Highlights from the American Folk Art Museum&quot; (2006), The museum has also repeatedly redeployed its permanent collection, experimenting with exhibiting it in different arrangements. In 2007, for the first time, other pieces are sharing the rooms dedicated to the original Frye collection; they are being juxtaposed against pieces from the Henry Art Gallery's founding collection.</description>

It is housed in the Grade II listed, neo-gothic former Oozells Street Board School, designed by John Henry Chamberlain in 1877. The gallery's current director is Jonathan Watkins. Ikon was set-up to encourage the public to engage in contemporary art. As a result of this, the gallery runs an off-site 'Education and Interpretation' scheme that educates audiences, promotes artists and their art. The gallery is open every day of the week except Mondays, though it opens on bank holiday Mondays. Featured artworks include all forms of media including sound, sculpture and photography as well as paintings. Exhibitions rotate throughout the year so that as many pieces can be displayed as possible.

The first public museum in the U.S. Intelligence Community, NCM is located in the former Colony Seven Motel, just two blocks from the NSA headquarters at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. The museum opened to the public on December 16, 1993, and now hosts about 50,000 visitors annually from all over the world. It is open Monday through Friday, 0900-1600 EST5EDT, as well as 1000-1400 EST5EDT on the first and third Saturdays of every month. It is closed on Sundays and all Federal holidays, and operates on NSA's snow closure schedule (e.g. if NSA is closed, the museum is closed as well). Next to the museum is the National Vigilance Park (NVP), where three reconnaissance aircraft are on display. The U.S. Army Seminole RU-8D Reconnaissance Plane represents the Army Airborne Signals Intelligence contribution in the Vietnam War, and a Hercules C-130 transport, modified to look like a reconnaissance-configuration C-130A, memorializes a U.S. Air Force aircraft shot down over Soviet Armenia during the Cold War. Finally, the park contains a U.S. Navy Skywarrior EA-3B, commemorating a mission in the Mediterranean on January 25, 1987 in which all seven crew members died. NCM and NVP are open to the public and admission is free. Donations to the NCM Foundation are accepted. Photography is allowed inside the museum, however, flash photography is prohibited in certain areas of the museum due to the age of some of the artifacts.</description>

            <description>Sainte-Marie Among the Hurons was a French Jesuit settlement in Wendake, the land of the Wendat, near modern Midland, Ontario, from 1639 to 1649. It was the first European settlement in what is now the province of Ontario. Eight missionaries from Sainte-Marie were martyred, and were canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in 1930. A reconstruction of the mission now operates as a living museum. Another nearby historic site, Carhagouha, marks the spot where an earlier Recollet missionary to Wendake, Fr. Joseph Le Caron, presided in 1615 over the first Catholic mass conducted in present-day Ontario.</description>

            <description>The New Jersey Naval Museum (NJNM), located along the Hackensack River in Hackensack, New Jersey, is dedicated to New Jersey's Navy heritage and naval history in general. The prominent element in the collection is the USS Ling (SS-297), a 312-foot (95 m) long Balao-class submarine of World War II. The museum is located along River Street and is operated by the Submarine Memorial Association. Guided tours of the Ling are available to take visitors from bow to stern, exploring equipment, quarters, and weaponry. The weaponry on the Ling includes twenty-four torpedoes and one 4&quot; deck gun (it originally had two 5&quot; deck guns) for handling military targets too small to warrant the expenditure of a torpedo. Along with Ling, volunteers maintain Japanese Kaiten IIs, a WWII Japanese suicide torpedo; a German Seehund, a WWII German two-man coastal defense submarine; and A Vietnam War-era Patrol Boat, River (PBR). The onshore museum building contains a number of different and unique items ranging from a United States Navy SEALs delivery vehicle to personal photographs and effects. Since 1972, the Museum had paid one dollar per year to rent its riverside site. In January 2007, the North Jersey Media Group, owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated. Efforts are being made to find an alternate site.</description>

            <name>Turner Contemporary</name>
            <address>Margate, Kent, England</address>
            <description>Turner Contemporary is a planned visual arts venue in Margate, Kent, England, to provide a visual arts space and regenerate the town. The title commemorates the association of the town with noted landscape painter J. M. W. Turner who went to school there and visited throughout his life. The original designs by Norwegian architects Snøhetta would have meant that the gallery would have formed part of the harbour itself. Some critics, however, questioned the prudence of placing part of Britain's national art treasures in a spot that is exposed to the full fury of the North Sea. The costs of the original design, and controversy over the decision to change its structure from concrete to steel, have led to a legal battle, in an attempt to recover some of the costs. It was later moved to a plot of land adjacent to the harbour on a site where Turner once stayed in a boarding house. The building was designed by David Chipperfield, whose design ideas for the 3 storey, 20 metres (66 ft) high gallery were praised unanimously. It will be on the raised promenade following a flood risk analysis. Construction started in 2008 and is planned to be completed in 2011, at a cost of £17.5 million. The scheme had been supported by the artist Tracey Emin, who was brought up in Margate, and various funding bodies including Kent County Council, with a £6.4 million contribution, Thanet District Council, who provided the land, South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), who provided £4 million the Arts Council England with support to the value of £4.1 million and the European Union. When the construction of the building has been completed, it will be the largest venue of its kind in the county.</description>

            <address>United Kingdom</address>
            <description>Imperial War Museum Duxford (commonly referred to simply as &quot;Duxford&quot;) is a branch of the Imperial War Museum near the village of Duxford in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. Britain's largest aviation museum, Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings. The site also provides storage space for the museum's other collections of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Anglian Regiment. Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome, the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War. During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. After the Ministry of Defence declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage. The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976. In keeping with the site's history many of Duxford's original buildings, such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. Many of these buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status, Duxford &quot;retain[ing ing] the best-preserved technical fabric remaining from [a historic airfield] up to November 1918&quot; and being &quot;remarkably well-preserved&quot;. The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the Stirling Prize-winning American Air Museum, designed by Sir Norman Foster. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular air shows. The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.</description>

            <description>The London Transport Museum, or LT Museum based in Covent Garden, London, seeks to conserve and explain the transport heritage of Britain's capital city. The majority of the museum's exhibits originated in the collection of London Transport, but, since the creation of Transport for London (TfL) in 2000, the remit of the museum has expanded to cover all aspects of transportation in the city. The museum operates from two sites within London. The main site in Covent Garden uses the name of its parent institution, sometimes suffixed by Covent Garden, and is open to the public every day, having recently reopened following a two year refurbishment. The other site, located in Acton, is known as the London Transport Museum Depot and is principally a storage site that is open on regular visitor days throughout the year. The museum was briefly re-named London's Transport Museum to reflect its coverage of topics beyond London Transport, but it reverted to its previous name in 2007 to coincide with the reopening of the Covent Garden site.</description>

The competition was won after in 1986 Baron Thyssen having tried to enlarge his Museum in Villa Favorita and searched for a location in Europe.</description>

            <address>Tervuren, Belgium</address>
            <description>The Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA) is an ethnographical and natural history museum in Tervuren, just outside Brussels, Belgium. It was first built to show off King Leopold II's Congo Free State for the 1897 World Exhibition. It focuses mainly on Congo, Belgium's former colony. The sphere of influence however (especially regarding to biological research) extends to the whole Congo River basin, Middle Africa, East Africa and West Africa, but tries to integrate Africa as a whole. First purely intended as a colonial museum, after 1960 it became more focused on ethnography and anthropology. Like in most museums, there is a research department and a public exhibit department. Not all research is pertaining to Africa, for example the research on the archaeozoology of Sagalassos. Some researchers have strong ties with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences.</description>

            <description>The National Coal Mining Museum for England (an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage) is based on the site of the old Caphouse Colliery at Overton in West Yorkshire, England. It opened in 1988 as the Yorkshire Mining Museum, it was granted national status in 1995. This mine was worked from at least 1789 until the seam was exhausted in 1985. Following the UK Miners' Strike (1984-1985) work was started to convert it into a museum. The miners were transferred to Denby Grange Colliery at nearby Netherton. The museum offers guided underground tours where visitors can see the conditions miners worked in and the tools and machines they used as the industry and the mine developed through the years. The extensive archive contains old issues of &quot;Coal News&quot; and details of collieries throughout England. Above ground there is a well resourced visitor centre including exhibitions on the social and industrial history of the mines, meet former working pit ponies, ride the paddy train, follow the nature trail, or play in the adventure playground. The NCM has occasionally featured in television programmes. In June 2005, Most Haunted Live! visited the location on Summer Solstice, while in 2006, Caphouse Colliery appeared in an advertising campaign for Pot Noodle, purporting to be a Noodle Mine in South Wales.</description>

            <description>The Cincinnati Art Museum is one of the oldest art museums in the United States. Founded in 1881, it was the first purpose-built art museum west of the Alleghenies. Its collection of over 60,000 works make it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Midwest. Museum founders debated locating the museum in either Burnett Woods, Eden Park, or downtown Cincinnati on Washington Square. Charles West, the major donor of the early museum, cast his votes in favor of Eden Park sealing its final location. The Romanesque-revival building designed by Cincinnati architect James W. McLaughlin opened in 1886. A series of additions and renovations have considerably altered the building over its 120 year history. In 2003, a major addition, The Cincinnati Wing http://www. cincinnati. com/cam/cincinnatiwing/ was added to house a permanent exhibit of art created for Cincinnati or by Cincinnati artists since 1788. The Cincinnati Wing includes fifteen new galleries covering 18,000 square feet (1,700 m) of well appointed space, and 400 objects. The Odoardo Fantacchiotti angels are two of the largest pieces in the collection. Fantacchiotti created these angels for the main altar of St. Peter in Chains Cathedral in the late 1840s. They were among the first European sculptures to come to Cincinnati. http://www. cincinnatiartmuseum. org/cincywing/tour_patronage. shtml. The Cincinnati Wing also contains the work of Frank Duveneck, Rookwood Pottery, Robert Scott Duncanson Mitchell and Rammelsberg (Cincinnati's premier 19th century furniture manufacturer) and a tall case clock by Luman Watson.</description>

            <description>The Somerset Rural Life Museum is situated in Glastonbury, Somerset, UK. It is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used as a Tithe barn for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey's home farm of approximately 524 acres. Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn. The barn which was built from local 'shelly' limestone, with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 the barn was given to the Duke of Somerset. By the early 20th century it was being used as a farm store by the Mapstone family. In 1974 they donated it to Somerset County Council and between 1976 and 1978 underwent restoration. The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian or early 20th Century period. Other exhibits show local crafts, including willow coppicing, mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay, peat digging on the Somerset Levels, and the production of milk, cheese, and cider. In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh, the story of one farm worker, John Hodges, is told from cradle to grave. Outside, there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep, in the cider apple orchard. Regular craft demonstrations and talks on farming are held, as are activities for children and families. There is a shop, tea room, free car park and disabled access. The shop and tea room are run by the Friends of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. Admission to the museum is free.</description>

It is located in Brooks, Oregon, United States, and is operated by the non-profit Antique Powerland Museum Association. It was initially established by a group of enthusiasts &quot;dedicated to the preservation, restoration and demonstration of steam powered equipment, antique farm machinery and implements. &quot; The museum is located on a 62-acre (250,000 m) parcel of land just off Interstate 5 in Brooks, and has been in operation (in various forms) since the 1970s. Originally, the site was primarily used for &quot;threshing bees&quot;, a forerunner to the modern tractor pull, and the remainder of the site committed to farming. With the addition of a truck museum and a railroad museum, the entire grounds were dedicated to exhibits; the current structure of Antique Powerland has been in operation since 1996. Each summer, Antique Powerland presents the Great Oregon Steam-Up, wherein many of the exhibits are fired up and displayed in an operational state. Despite the name, many different types of power equipment are displayed, including steam-powered equipment, diesel-powered equipment, gasoline-powered equipment, and electric-powered equipment.</description>

            <description>Mackenzie House is a historic building and museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that was the last home of the city's first mayor William Lyon Mackenzie. Mackenzie was forced into exile in the United States after having led the Rebellion of 1837. He returned to the newly-created Province of Canada in 1850, and died in this house in 1861. Mackenzie House is purportedly haunted by William Mackenzie, allegedly seen working his printing press. The neighbouring row houses were demolished in 1936, while Mackenzie's grandson, William Lyon Mackenzie King, was Prime Minister. However, this house was saved because of its historical significance. Designed in the Georgian architecture style, today the house serves as a municipally-run historic house museum about 1860s Victorian life.</description>

Located at Sultan Gate of Kampong Glam, the 8,000 square metre (2 acre) centre was launched on 27 November 2004. The building was once the Istana Kampong Glam and Gedung Kuning, and was part of a larger original compound that led to the Beach Road frontage. Sultan Gate has been known as such since the 1950s. The Malay Heritage Foundation, formed in 28 July 1999, embarked on a major restoration project of the Istana Kampong Glam in 1999. Completed in 2004, it reopened as the Malay Heritage Centre. On the grounds of the Malay Heritage Centre are Gelam trees, the replica of a Bugis prahu or boat, and information markers on the history of the Bugis people and their trade. The centre houses the Malay Heritage Museum, which preserves and showcase the Malay culture and heritage in Singapore, through historic artefacts, multimedia and diorama displays, and exhibits. The centre also organizes Malay cultural programmes and workshops, and together with fund-raising activities contribute to two-thirds of its operational costs. In 2008, the Singapore Government announced their move to provide full S$1.7 million a year funding, to the Heritage Centre, from the one-third funding provided to them in the previous years. The funding and aid from the National Heritage Board will boost the centre to become a museum of international standard, and allow opportunities to work with other top regional museums in Indonesia and Malaysia.</description>

            <description>The Bogyoke Aung San Museum, located in Bahan, Yangon, is a museum dedicated to General Aung San, the founder of modern Myanmar (Burma). Established in 1962, the two-story museum was Aung San's last residence before his assassination in July 1947. It is the house where his daughter Aung San Suu Kyi grew up as a child. The museum, with its focus on Gen. Aung San's short adult life, is complementary to the Bogyoke Aung San Residence Museum in Natmauk, Magwe Division, which is dedicated to his childhood and family memorabilia. It houses exhibits on his life story and general memorabilia which includes clothing, books, furniture, family photos and the late general's car. The museum is opened only for three hours each year&amp;ndash; on the Martyrs' Day of 19th July, from 9 am to noon. The restriction is in line with the current military government's policy of restricting any mention of Gen. Aung San in the media in order to marginalize Aung San Suu Kyi. The museum is listed on the Yangon City Heritage List.</description>

            <description>Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve (134 acres) is a nature preserve, botanical garden and accredited museum located at 1635 River Road (Pennsylvania Route 32), New Hope, Pennsylvania. It is open daily except for major holidays; an admission fee is charged. A non-profit organization, Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve Association Inc. , maintains the park in accordance to a management agreement with the Pennsylvania Historic Museum Commission. The preserve was established in 1934 within the Washington Crossing Historic Park at the site where George Washington's army camped during the American Revolutionary War. Just five miles south of the preserve, Washington and his men crossed the Delaware River to fight and win the Battle of Trenton in 1776. Today the preserve contains nearly 1,000 of the 2,000 plant species native to Pennsylvania, growing in a naturalistic setting of woodlands, meadows, a pond, and Pidcock Creek, with some 2½ miles of walking trails. It is an excellent site for bird-watching. The visitor center includes a collection of nearly 100 taxidermic birds, over 200 nests, and some 600 eggs, given in 1972 by local ornithologist Charles Platt and displayed in dioramas, exhibit cases and photographic panels. Group reservations are available for the Pavilion at the Bownman's Hill Wildflower Preserve, which can accommodate 80 to 100 people. The Pavilion is open for anyone's use.</description>

            <description>The Columbus Lighthouse (Faro a Colón in Spanish) is a monument located in Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic, in tribute to Christopher Columbus. Construction began in 1948 using plans drawn by J. -L. Gloeave. In time for the 500th anniversary of the Discovery of America, the monument was inaugurated in 1992. It was funded by the Latin American states and the total cost of construction was approximately $70 million. The monument's lighthouse-style features project beams of light, forming a cross shape, which are so powerful they can be seen from Puerto Rico. Containing what are purported to be the remains of Columbus, the monument is both a mausoleum and a museum showcasing objects including a boat from Cuba and the Columbian jewelry. Constructed of concrete, the monument is half a mile long, its architecture is cross-shaped and represents the Christianization of America. The monument is controversial.</description>

            <description>Château Laroche, also known as the Loveland Castle, is a museum on the banks of the Little Miami River in Loveland, Ohio, United States. A folly of a historical European castle, construction began in 1929 by Boy Scout troop leader Harry Andrews. He built the castle on two free plots of land that his scouts obtained by paying for one-year subscriptions to The Cincinnati Enquirer. When Andrews died in 1981 he willed the castle to his Boy Scout troop the Knights of the Golden Trail (KOGT). The Castle has been extensively upgraded and renovated in the years since Andrews death and has been mostly completed by the KOGT. The East tower now houses a short video presentation on Andrews' quest to finish his dream. The walls of the upstairs chapel feature many stones brought back by Andrews in his world travels and others sent to him from foreign locations by his friends and followers. Recently completed are an expansion to the outside gardens and a greenhouse. Tales of the castle being haunted &amp;ndash; often coming from Chateau Laroche's own volunteer knights &amp;ndash; have been reported over the years.</description>

            <description>The Museum of Anatolian Civilizations is located on the south side of Ankara Castle in the Atpazarı area in Ankara, Turkey. It consists of the old Ottoman Mahmut Paşa bazaar storage building, and the Kurşunlu Han. Because of Atatürk's desire to establish a Hittite museum, the buildings were bought upon the suggestion of Hamit Zübeyir Koşay, who was then Culture Minister, to the National Education Minister, Saffet Arıkan. After the remodelling and repairs were completed (1938 -1968), the building was opened to the public as the Ankara Archaeological Museum. It is one of the richest museums in the world. Today, Kurşunlu Han, used as an administrative building, houses the work rooms, library, conference hall, laboratory and workshop. The old bazaar building houses the exhibits. Within this Ottoman building, the museum has a number of exhibits of Anatolian archeology. They start with the Paleolithic era, and continue chronologically through the Neolithic, Early Bronze, Assyrian trading colonies, Hittite, Phrygian, Urartian, Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman periods. There is also an extensive collection of artifacts from the excavations at Karain, Çatalhöyük, Hacılar, Canhasan, Beyce Sultan, Alacahöyük, Kültepe, Acemhöyük, Boğazköy, Pazarlı, Altıntepe, Adilcevaz and Patnos as well as examples of several periods. The exhibits of gold, silver, glass, marble and bronze works date back as far as the second half of the first millennium BC. The coin collections, with examples ranging from the first minted money to modern times, represent the museum's rare cultural treasures. Museum of Anatolian Civilizations reaching the present time with its historical buildings and its deeply rooted history was elected as the first &quot;European Museum of the Year&quot; in Switzerland on April 19, 1997.</description>

            <description>The Museum of Bath at Work is at Camden Works, Julian Road, in Bath, Somerset, England. This museum was established in 1978 to present the commercial development of Bath over the last 2000 years and includes displays on four floors. The main exhibit is the reconstruction of an engineering and mineral water making business set up by Victorian entrepreneur Jonathan Bowler in 1864. When the firm closed in 1969 the original premises of the firm were cleared of all the movable objects - almost one million of them - and the interiors of this firm reconstructed in the museum. One thousand photographs taken of the original business were used in the reconstruction of shop, workshops, offices, bottling plant, etc. Over 10,000 bottles were saved and a collection of half a million documents were also saved. Other reconstructions at the museum include a cabinet maker's workshop and a Bath Stone quarry face complete with crane, tools, etc. In 1999 a rare Horstmann car, built in 1914 was acquired, and, in 2003, a comprehensive exhibition on Bath's development, 'Bath at Work : 2000 Years of Earning a Living' opened. A local history display in the Hudson Gallery opened in 2007 and features an ever changing display of photographs. In 2008 the only known example of a horizontal Griffin cycle gas engine was acquired. Audio guides are available and interactive exhibits allow access to the exhibitions.</description>

The cloister, owing to its beauty, is one of the highlights of the museum. It hosts temporary exhibits and through it one can access three rooms decorated to resemble a dining room, a cabinet and a chapel from the times of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The upper cloister features the public library, where several items are on display. It holds over 14,000 books, many of them rare and antique, as well as historical documents and over 800 editions of the book &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (Don Quijote de la Mancha).

The Peace Museum is the part of the school building with the basement of the former Municipal Fukuromachi Elementary School in Hiroshima. The school is keeping it, to convey the facts of the atomic bomb, to learn about peace, and to send their information to the world.</description>

            <address>Kings Weston, Bristol</address>
            <description>Kings Weston Roman Villa is a Roman villa near Lawrence Weston in the north west of Bristol. The villa was discovered during the construction of the Lawrence Weston housing estate in 1947. Two distinct buildings (Eastern and Western) were discovered, the Eastern building was fully excavated (in 1948–50), the other lies mostly below Long Cross road. Finds from the site are now held in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. George C. Boon and John Brown conducted the excavations of the Eastern building. In a hypocaust, underlying the mosaic floor of one of the wings, they discovered the body of a man of approximately fifty years of age, 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. Injuries to the skull and shoulder suggested that he had died violently. Coins of the Valentinian and Gratian periods led to a conclusion that the man may have died in a Viking raid in the latter part of the fourth or early fifth century CE. Two other bodies were found in the vicinity. Traces of decorated walls, mosaic floors, underfloor heating and bath suites were discovered. Based on the dating of coins and other evidence such as a foundation burial of a young pig, it was suggested that the site had been occupied since the third century CE. The layout of the building, dominated by a large hall, relatively common in Britain and Germany, led to the hypotheses by archaeologist J. T. Smith that this type of building was used by an extended family group rather than nuclear family. The villa forms part of the collection of Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.</description>

Most of the centre is located underground, in an excavated glacial formation that shows the exposed bedrock of the hill. The museum is named for philanthropist Paul Johnson and opened in 2002. The building is designed to take advantage of the geological features of Signal Hill where most of the structure is below ground exposing natural rock formations. The area was originally a peat filled area that was stripped of overburden and a glass-encased structure of 2.5 stories was build atop the excavation. The building was built through the Johnson Family Foundation at a cost of $12 million. The building utilizes a heating and cooling system via six geothermal wells drilled to a depth of 500 feet.</description>

Located in the Charleston Historic District, the Gibbes houses a premier collection of over 10,000 works of fine art, principally American works, many with a connection to Charleston or the South. The benefactor, James Shoolbred Gibbes, donated $100,000 to the Carolina Arts Association upon his death in 1899 for the &quot;erection of a suitable building for the exhibitions of paintings&quot;. Not receiving the money until 1903, the Association hired Frank Pierce Milburn to design the gallery. His design included a Tiffany-style dome, Doric columns and pediment capped windows and doors. The museum's collections include the work of numerous artists with connections to Charleston; among them are Henrietta Johnston, Mary Roberts, and Jeremiah Theus.</description>

            <description>The National Museum of American Jewish History is a museum in Center City Philadelphia, located on Independence Mall within the Independence National Historical Park. It was founded in 1976, and have been sharing a building with Congregation Mikveh Israel ever since. The Museum is in the process of having a new museum built, very modern looking. The National Museum of American Jewish History is constructing a new 100,000–square-foot, five-story building, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects that will open its doors November, of 2010. The new Museum building will stand directly across from the Liberty Bell, a block south of the National Constitution Center, and one block north of the birthplace of American liberty, Independence Hall. The new building will serve as a cornerstone of the modern-day American Jewish community. The core exhibition of the new Museum will trace the lives of American Jews from 1654 to the present and will encompass some 25,000 square feet (2,300 m) of gallery space on three floors. An additional 5,000 square feet (460 m) of gallery space is provided for changing exhibitions. The ground floor will feature an evolving multimedia exhibition, titled Only in America Gallery/Hall of Fame, which will highlight the accomplishments of many Jewish Americans. Exhibits will explore how Jews created a new home in a free land and will examine how America shaped the lives, communities and livelihoods of its Jewish citizens. Exhibits will also explore how Jews shaped America, using their unprecedented freedom not only to create the largest and most prosperous Jewish community in the world, but also to help make America one of the most successful and vital countries in the world. The exhibition will draw on the Museum’s permanent collection of approximately 20,000 objects whose origins span from the Colonial period to the present day, vividly evoking the diversity of the American Jewish experience. The collection includes 18th-century ritual and domestic silver; ritual objects and embroidered textiles carried to America by 19th-century Jewish immigrants; original drawings, prints, paintings and sculptures that illustrate the American Jewish experience; rare books, posters and other printed materials; photographs, scrapbooks and illuminated certificates; and a variety of manuscript materials, including poetry, letters, diaries and personal memoirs. Leading the committee of scholars who are developing the content of the core exhibition is Dr. Jonathan D. Sarna, Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis University. Gallagher &amp;amp; Associates of Bethesda, Maryland, is designing the core exhibition. The new building will also allow for expanded programming and activities that are not possible in the current facility. Major spaces will include a Center for Jewish Education that will serve schoolchildren and young adults of every background, the 200-seat Dell Family Theater, an event space overlooking Independence Mall and a gift shop. Michael Rosenzweig, a lawyer and former law professor at the University of Michigan, serves as the museum's President and Chief Executive Officer.</description>

            <description>The Anniston Museum of Natural History is a museum in Lagarde Park, Anniston, Alabama, exhibiting more than 2,000 natural history items on permanent display, including minerals, fossils, and rare animals in open dioramas. In addition to exploring Alabama’s natural heritage, the museum features diorama-style exhibits that begin in pre-history and extend to the North American wilderness and the African savannah. Each of the museum's seven exhibit halls explores a different natural history theme. The Environments of Africa Hall contains more than 100 African animals displayed in simulated natural settings. Other highlights include 2,000-year-old Egyptian mummies from the Ptolemaic period, a cave-dwelling creatures exhibit and a children’s discovery room. The Dynamic Earth depicts the planet's formation and includes minerals, fossils, gemstones and dinosaurs. Nature Space offers a large learning area with hands-on activities. On the grounds are a wildlife garden, open-air animal exhibits, nature trails and the Berman Museum of World History. A Changing Exhibit Gallery provides fresh exhibits on a regular basis. The museum's history dates from 1930, when H. Severn Regar offered his personal collection of historical objects and biological specimens to the city of Anniston. Included were extinct and endangered species collected by 19th-century naturalist William Werner. This gift formed the cornerstone of the museum’s Birds of the Americas exhibit hall, which features more than 400 specimens of North American birds in their habitats. The museum is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.</description>

Built on a 28,000 square meter plot of land, with 8,000 square meter of interior spaces, it is the second largest museum of Greece. The area surrounding the museum compromises of a 500 square meter pool, a shiny metallic dome and greenery. In the near future, the vacant land next to the museum will be turned into a cultural park. It houses collections about the history of Patras and the surrounding area from prehistory to the end of Roman times. The museum was designed by the architect Mr. Theofanis Bobotis with an original cost of 21.5 million euros that ended up on a total of 25 million.

The museum has four thematic sections, three of which permanent and one periodic. From the three permanent, currently only two are open to the public with the third expected to be opened by the end of the year. The periodic section will be hosting various exhibitions around the year. According to the archaeologists of the 6th Antiquity Conservancy, the 70% of the items exhibited are seeing the light of the day for the first time in the past thirty years.

            <address>Hobart, Tasmania, Australia</address>
            <description>The Maritime Museum of Tasmania is a privately operated maritime museum dedicated to the history of Tasmania's association with the sea, ships, and ship-building, and is located at Carnegie House in Sullivans Cove, Hobart, Tasmania. The island state of Tasmania has a long and rich history of association with the sea, going back well before the time of British invasion and settlement on the island. The indigenous Tasmanians were known to have strong affiliations with the sea, and surrounding islands. The British of course arrived by sea, and since the time of their first arrival in 1803, Tasmania has had a continuous history or sailing, maritime trade, fishing and other maritime activities. The museum sets out to chart, document and display materials and artefacts related to that history. Maritime enthusiasts first began to argue that the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery should include a room dedicated to Tasmania's maritime history in the 1930's. However it wasn't until 1972, when six volunteers decided to create a dedicated museum, that the Maritime Museum of Tasmania was born. It was originally housed in St. George's Church, Battery Point, and opened in 1973, with an official opening in 1974. In 1983 the museum relocated into Secheron House, a much more appropriate location, and this also allowed the museum to expand. The Government of Tasmania decided to sell Secheron House in 1999, and the Museum took the opportunity to relocate and develop into a major educational institution and public attraction. The museum relocated to its current home, the Carnegie Building, which placed it alongside the docks of Sullivans Cove, in close proximity to both the CBD and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. The new expanded and modern renovated Carnegie building was opened as the Maritime Museum of Tasmania by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 2000.</description>

            <address>Somerville, Massachusetts</address>
            <description>The Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is &quot;to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum&quot;. It has two branches, one in Dedham, Massachusetts, and the other in nearby Somerville. Its permanent collection includes 500 pieces of &quot;art too bad to be ignored&quot;, 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time. MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection required its own viewing space. The museum moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: &quot;While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst. &quot; To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate kitsch. MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to Boston, featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine noted that the attention the Museum of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying &quot;the best bad art&quot;. The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, &quot;We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously.&quot;</description>

With CEU's entry into the Utah State University system on July 1, 2010, efforts are currently underway to finalize a possible new name and brand for the museum.</description>

            <description>The Maritime Museum is a museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Located in the Gärdet section of the inner-city district Östermalm, the museum offers a panoramic view of the bay Djurgårdsbrunnsviken. The building was built to the design of the architect Ragnar Östberg between 1933 and 1936. On the bottom floor there are, among other things, exhibits on naval history including several detailed models of 18th century ships. The second floor includes exhibits on Swedish commercial fleets. In the basement is a cabin from King Gustav III's ship &quot;Amphion&quot;. The gently curved building, inspired by the neoclassicist design of Olof Tempelman (1746-1816), acts as a background for the surrounding park where open-air concerts are held each year. It was the last major commission of Ragnar Östberg, who also designed the Stockholm City Hall, and was built on the location for the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930) (Stockholmsutställningen 1930). As the exhibition was an important Functionalism manifestation, the museum also mark the point of view of the architect in the debate the introduction of Functionalist style caused in Sweden. The central cupola is entirely built in brick. Outside of the museum is a statue simply called &quot;The Sailor&quot; (Sjömannen), a memorial to the Swedish sailors who died during World War II.</description>

            <description>Bletchley Park, also known as Station X, is an estate located in the town of Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, England. During World War II, Bletchley Park was the site of the United Kingdom's main decryption establishment, the Government Code and Cypher School. Ciphers and codes of several Axis countries were decrypted there, most importantly ciphers generated by the German Enigma and Lorenz machines. The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort. Harry Hinsley, a Bletchley veteran and the official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, has said that Ultra shortened the war &quot;by not less than two years and probably by four years&quot;; moreover, in the absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended. Bletchley Park is now a museum run by the Bletchley Park Trust and is open to the public. The main manor house is also available for functions and is licensed for ceremonies. Part of the fees for hiring the facilities go to the Trust to maintain the museum. Since 1967, Bletchley has been part of Milton Keynes.</description>

            <name>National Gallery</name>
            <address>Trafalgar Square, London WC2, England, United Kingdom</address>
            <description>The National Gallery in London was founded in 1824 and houses a rich collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900 in its home on Trafalgar Square. The gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the public of the United Kingdom and entry to the main collection (though not some special exhibitions) is free of charge. Unlike comparable art museums such as the Louvre in Paris or the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of the insurance broker and patron of the arts John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which comprise two thirds of the collection. The resulting collection is small in size, compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting &quot;from Giotto to Cézanne&quot; are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is no longer the case. The present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins from 1832–8. Only the façade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. The building often came under fire for its perceived aesthetic deficiencies and lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897. The Sainsbury Wing, an extension to the west by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, is a notable example of Postmodernist architecture in Britain. The current Director of the National Gallery is Nicholas Penny.</description>

            <description>The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is an art museum beside the National Mall, in Washington, D.C. , the United States. The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn. It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It was conceived as the United States' museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition-planning mainly on the post–World War II period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years. Notable artists in the collection include: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, John Chamberlain, David Smith, Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Milton Avery, Ellsworth Kelly, Louise Nevelson, Arshile Gorky, Edward Hopper, Larry Rivers, and Raphael Soyer among others. Outside the museum is a sculpture garden, featuring works by artists including Auguste Rodin, Jeff Koons, and Alexander Calder. The building itself is as much of an attraction as anything inside, likened by many to a large spacecraft parked on the National Mall. The building is essentially an open cylinder elevated by four massive &quot;legs&quot;, with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard. Before Gordon Bunshaft, of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, designed the building, the Smithsonian staff reportedly told him that, if it did not provide a striking contrast to everything else in the city, then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection.</description>

            <description>The State Hermitage is a museum of art and culture in Saint Petersburg, Russia. One of the largest and oldest museums of the world, it was founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great and open to the public since 1852. Its collections, of which only a small part is on permanent display, comprise nearly 3 million items, including the largest collection of paintings in the world. The collections occupy a large complex of six historic buildings along Palace Embankment, including the Winter Palace, a former residence of Russian emperors. Apart from them, the Menshikov Palace, Museum of Porcelain, Storage Facility at Staraya Derevnya and the eastern wing of the General Staff Building also make part of the museum. The museum has several exhibition centers abroad. The Hermitage is a federal state property. Since 1990, the director of the museum has been Mikhail Piotrovsky. Out of six buildings of the main museum complex, four, namely the Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage and New Hermitage, are partially open to the public. The other two are Hermitage Theatre and the Reserve House. The entrance ticket for foreign tourists costs several times as much as the fee paid by Russian citizens. However, the entrance is free of charge the first Thursday of every month for all visitors and daily for students and children. The museum is closed on Mondays. Entrance is in the Winter Palace from Palace Embankment or the Courtyard.</description>

            <address>Lambeth Road, London, England</address>
            <description>The Imperial War Museum is a British national museum organisation with branches at five locations in England, three of which are in London. The museum was founded during the First World War in 1917 and intended as a record of the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire. Today the museum gives its mission as &quot;to enable people to have an informed understanding of modern war and its impact on individuals and society&quot;. Originally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill, the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924 the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington, and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but the post-war period saw the museum enter a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, and which serves as the organisation's corporate headquarters. During the 1970s the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford. In 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms, an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of Imperial War Museum North in Trafford, Greater Manchester, the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. The museum's collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs, film and video material, and oral history recordings; an extensive library, a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment and other artefacts. The museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. Admission is free to Imperial War Museum London and Imperial War Museum North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The current Chairman of the Trustees is Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Squire. Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been Diane Lees.</description>

            <description>The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (MNCARS) is the official name of Spain's national museum of 20th century art (informally shortened to the Museo Reina Sofía, Queen Sofia Museum, El Reina Sofia, or simply The Sofia). The museum was officially inaugurated on September 10, 1992 and is named for Queen Sofia of Spain. It is located in Madrid, near the Atocha train and metro stations, at the southern end of the so-called Golden Triangle of Art (located along the Paseo del Prado and also comprising the Museo del Prado and the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza). The museum is mainly dedicated to Spanish art. Highlights of the museum include excellent collections of Spain's two greatest 20th century masters, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. Certainly the most famous masterpiece in the museum is Picasso's painting Guernica. The Reina Sofía also has fine collections of the works of Juan Gris, Joan Miró, Julio González, Eduardo Chillida, Antoni Tàpies, Pablo Gargallo, Pablo Serrano, Lucio Muñoz, Luis Gordillo, Jorge Oteiza, José Gutiérrez Solana and many other significant artists. Foreign artists are few, but there are works by Robert Delaunay, Yves Tanguy, Man Ray, Jacques Lipchitz, Lucio Fontana, Yves Klein, cubist still-lifes by Georges Braque and a large work by Francis Bacon. It also hosts a free-access library specializing in art, with a collection of over 100,000 books, over 3,500 sound recordings and almost 1,000 videos. The central building of the museum was an 18th century hospital. Extensive modern renovations and additions to the old building were made starting in 1980. In 1988 portions of the new museum were opened to the public, mostly in temporary configurations; that same year it was decreed a national museum. An 8000 m (86,000 ft) expansion costing €92 million designed by French architect Jean Nouvel opened October 2005.</description>

            <address>Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</address>
            <description>The Canadian War Museum (CWM) is Canada’s national museum of military history. Located in Ottawa, Ontario, the museum covers all facets of Canada’s military past, from the first recorded instances of death by armed violence in Canadian history several thousand years ago to the country’s most recent involvement in conflicts. It includes major permanent exhibitions on wars that have been fought on Canadian soil, the total wars of the twentieth century, the Cold War and peace support operations abroad, and Canada’s history of honouring and remembrance. There is also an open storage area displaying large objects from the Museum’s collection, from naval guns to tanks, from motorcycles to jet aircraft. The exhibits depict Canada’s military past in its personal, national and international dimensions, with special emphasis on the human experience of war and the manner in which war has affected, and been affected by, Canadians’ participation. Much of the Museum’s public exhibition space is devoted to its Canadian Experience Galleries, its main permanent exhibition space. These displays underline the profound effect that war has had on Canada’s development and the significant role Canadians have played in international conflicts. Their content is a rich mixture of some 2,500 objects from war art to armoured vehicles, as well as scores of audio-visual displays and many hands-on activities.

            <description>Tate St Ives is an art gallery in St Ives, Cornwall, England, exhibiting work by modern British artists, including work of the St Ives School. The three story building, designed by architects Evans and Shalev, lies on the site of an old gas works, overlooking Porthmeor Beach. It was opened in 1993, the second regional gallery in the Tate Gallery network. However, the Tate also manages an earlier property in St Ives, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden which it opened in 1980. An extension to the gallery has been proposed in response to the large numbers of visitors the gallery attracts, with the aims of providing better education spaces and accommodating larger works of art. The plans have met with fierce objections from some parts of the local community. On 20th July 2010, Cornwall Council successfully bought the land for the proposed extension from the Penwith Housing Association which has pledged to use the money to build more homes for elderly people in the town. Whilst Tate St Ives seeks to preserve the history of twentieth-century art in St Ives, the gallery also exhibits new work from artists working further afield. The gallery's artist residency programme aims to develop the professional practice of artists who live and work in Cornwall.</description>

            <description>The Black Country Living Museum (formerly The Black Country Museum) is an open-air museum of rebuilt historic buildings, located in Dudley in the West Midlands of England. The museum occupies a 105,000 square metres (26 acres) urban heritage park in the shadow of Dudley Castle in the centre of the Black Country conurbation. It was first opened in 1978, on land partly reclaimed from a former railway goods yard, disused lime kilns and former coal pits, and since then many more exhibits have been added to it. The Museum preserves some notable buildings from around the Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall and the City of Wolverhampton; mainly in a specially built village. Most of the buildings are original, relocated from their original sites. As a living museum, these form a base from which volunteers portray life in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Museum is constantly changing as new exhibits, especially buildings in the village, are being added. While most of the exhibits are indoors, on a wet day suitable clothing is recommended for walking between buildings.</description>

The Museum holds the world's largest collection of Aboriginal bark paintings and stone tools, the heart of champion racehorse Phar Lap and the Holden prototype No. 1 car. The Museum also develops and travels exhibitions on subjects ranging from bushrangers to surf lifesaving. The National Museum of Australia Press publishes a wide range of books, catalogues and journals. The Museum's Centre for Historical Research takes a cross-disciplinary approach to history, ensuring the museum is a lively forum for ideas and debate about Australia's past, present and future.

            <description>The Vasa Museum is a maritime museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Located on the island of Djurgården, the museum displays the only almost fully intact 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628. The Vasa Museum opened in 1990 and, according to the official web site, is the most visited museum in Scandinavia. Together with other museums such as Stockholm Maritime Museum, the museum belongs to the Swedish National Maritime Museums (SNMM). From the end of 1961 to 1988 Vasa was housed in a temporary structure called Wasavarvet (&quot;The Vasa Shipyard&quot;) where she was treated with polyethylene glycol. Visitors could only view the ship from two levels and the maximum distance was only 5 m (17 ft). In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent Vasa museum was to be constructed and an architects' competition for the design of the museum building was organized. A total of 384 architects sent in models of their ideas for the most suitable building to house the Vasa and the final winners were Marianne Dahlbäck and Göran Månsson with Ask (&quot;box&quot;). The construction of the new building began on and around the dry dock of the old naval yard with an inauguration ceremony hosted by Prince Bertil on 2 November 1987. Vasa was towed into the flooded dry dock under the new building in December 1988 and during the summer of 1989, when visitors were allowed onto the construction site, 228 000 people visited the half-finished museum. The museum was officially opened on 15 June 1990. So far Vasa has been seen by over 25 million people. In 2008 the museum had a total of 1,143,404 visitors.</description>

            <description>Derby Industrial Museum, also known as The Silk Mill, is a museum of industry and history in Derby, England. The museum is housed in a historic former silk mill which marks the southern end of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. Between 1717 and 1721 George Sorocold built Britain’s first mill for the Lombe brothers, beside the River Derwent. This mill was built to house machines for &quot;doubling&quot; or twisting silk into thread. John Lombe copied the design for the machines used for spinning large quantities of silk, during a period spent in Italy, working within the Italian Silk Industry. This was possibly the first example of industrial espionage. Traditionally the spinning wheel had been used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters, the new large, machines were capable of producing far greater quantities of silk and were to become serious competition for the Italians. These machines however required large buildings and a considerable power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new Silk Mill drove the massive spinning machines. John Lombe died in 1722 under mysterious circumstances, and was believed to have been poisoned by an Italian assassin in retribution for stealing their trade secrets. His half brother, Sir Thomas Lombe Knt. , died June 2, 1739 leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters. Dame Elizabeth advertised the lease for sale in 1739 the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for £2,800. Richard Wilson remained in Leeds leaving the running of the mill to his partners, William and Samuel Lloyd, both London merchants, with Thomas Bennet as salaried manager, taking a proportion of the profits. A description of the mill by William Wilson dating from sometime between 1739 and 1753 has survived: “ The original &quot;Italian&quot; works of five storeys high housed 26 Italian winding engines that spun the raw silk on each of the upper three floors whilst the lower two storeys contained eight spinning mills producing basic thread and four twist mills. ”</description>

            <address>New Haven, Connecticut</address>
            <description>The Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University is among the oldest, largest, and most prolific university natural history museums in the world. It was founded by the philanthropist George Peabody in 1866 at the behest of his nephew Othniel Charles Marsh, the early paleontologist. Most known to the public for its Great Hall of Dinosaurs, which includes a mounted juvenile Apatosaurus and the 110-foot (34 m) long mural, The Age of Reptiles; it also has permanent exhibits dedicated to human and mammal evolution; wildlife dioramas, Egyptian artifacts; and the birds, minerals and Native Americans of Connecticut. The Peabody Museum is located at 170 Whitney Avenue in New Haven, Connecticut, USA, and is run by almost one hundred staff members. While the original building was demolished in 1917, it moved to its current location in 1925, and has since expanded to occupy the Peabody Museum, the attached Bingham and Kline Laboratories, parts of three additional buildings, and a field station at the Long Island Sound. The museum also owns Horse Island in the Thimble Islands, which is not opened to the public, but used for experiments. Space is used for storage, work, and classrooms. The Environmental Science Center, completed in 2001 and connected to the museum and the adjacent Kline Geology Laboratory, hosts approximately one-half of the museum's 12 million specimens. The Peabody has several world-important collections. Perhaps the most notable are the vertebrate paleontology collections, among the largest, most extensive, and most historically important fossil collections in the United States, and the Hiram Bingham Collection of Incan artifacts from Machu Picchu, named for the famous Yale archaeologist who discovered this Peruvian ruin. Also notable are the extensive ornithology collection, one of the largest and most taxonomically inclusive in the world, and the associated William Robertson Coe Ornithology Library, one of the best in the United States. The collection of marine invertebrates is additionally extensive, having benefitted from the work of such prolific invertebrate zoologists as Addison Emery Verrill. Faculty curators for the collections are drawn from Yale's departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Geology and Geophysics, and Anthropology. Because these departments maintain a strong tradition of hiring faculty who will perform collections-based research, especially after the renewed support for organismal biology at Yale under President Richard Charles Levin and in particular former provost Alison Richard, nearly all of the collections are under active internal use and enjoy continuous and considerable growth.</description>

Scipione Borghese was an early patron of Bernini and an avid collector of works by Caravaggio, who is well represented in the collection by his Boy with a Basket of Fruit, St. Jerome, Sick Bacchus and others. Other paintings of note include Titian's Sacred and Profane Love, Raphael's Entombment of Christ and works by Peter Paul Rubens and Federico Barocci.</description>

It was built in 1882 as a gift from the sugar baron Peter Redpath. It houses collections of interest to ethnology, biology, paleontology, and mineralogy/geology. The collections were started by some of the same individuals who founded the Smithsonian and Royal Ontario Museum collections. The current director is David Green. Commissioned by Redpath to mark the 25th anniversary of Sir John William Dawson's appointment as Principal, the Museum was designed by A.C. Hutchison and A. D. Steele. McGill University's Redpath Museum Web site characterizes it as an &quot;idiosyncratic expression of eclectic Victorian Classicism&quot; as well as &quot;an unusual and late example of the Greek Revival in North America. &quot; It is the oldest building built specifically to be a museum in Canada. Both the museum's interior and exterior have been utilized as a set, for movies and commercials.</description>

            <address>Moscow, Russia</address>
            <description>The State Historical Museum of Russia is a museum of Russian history wedged between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers in the millions. The spot where the museum now stands was formerly occupied by the Principal Medicine Store, built on the order of Peter the Great in the Moscow baroque style. Several rooms in that building housed royal collections of antiquities. Other rooms were occupied by the Moscow University, founded by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1755. The museum was founded in 1872 by Ivan Zabelin, Aleksey Uvarov and several other Slavophiles interested in promotion of Russian history and national self-awareness. The board of trustees, composed of Sergey Solovyov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Uvarov and other leading historians, presided over construction of the museum building. After a prolonged competition the project was awarded to Vladimir Osipovich Shervud (or Sherwood, 1833-97). The present structure was built to Sherwood's neo-Russian design between 1875 and 1881. The first eleven exhibit halls officially opened in 1883 during a visit from the Tsar and his wife. Then in 1894 Tsar Alexander III became the honorary president of the museum and the following year, 1895, the museum was renamed the Tsar Alexander III Imperial Russian History Museum. Its interiors were intricately decorated in the Russian Revival style by such artists as Viktor Vasnetsov, Henrik Semiradsky, and Ivan Aivazovsky. During the Soviet period the murals were proclaimed gaudy and were plastered over. The museum went through a painstaking restoration of its original appearance between 1986 and 1997.

The museum is located across the street from Union Station, in the building that once served as the Main Post Office of Washington, D.C. from 1914, when it was constructed, until 1986. The building was designed by the Graham and Burnham architectural firm, which was led by Ernest Graham following the death of Daniel Burnham in 1912. The museum houses many interactive displays about the history of the United States Postal Service and of mail service around the world. Also on display is a vast collection of stamps. The museum houses a gift shop and a separate stamp shop, along with exhibits on the Pony Express, the use of railroads with the mail, and even an exhibit on direct marketing called, &quot;What's in the Mail for You,&quot; that produces a souvenir envelope with your name printed on it and a coupon for the gift shop. As a Smithsonian museum, admission is free. Since 2002 the museum has presented the Smithsonian Philatelic Achievement Award every two years. In September, 2009, the museum received a $8 million gift from investment firm founder William H. Gross to help finance the expansion of the museum.</description>

            <description>The McLaughlin Planetarium is a former working planetarium whose building occupies a space immediately to the south of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, at 100 Queen's Park. Founded by a grant from philanthropist Colonel R. Samuel McLaughlin, the facility was opened to the public on October 26, 1968. It had, for its time, a state-of-the-art electro-mechanical Zeiss planetarium projector that was used to project regular themed shows about the stars, planets, and cosmology for visitors. By the 1980s the planetarium's sound-system and domed ceiling were used to display dazzling music-themed laser-light shows. The lower levels of the planetarium contained a gallery called the &quot;Astrocentre&quot; that featured space-related exhibits, related artifacts on the history of astronomy and was also home of the world's first commercial Stellarium Starting in 1978 there was a decline in attendance that lasted for four years while major construction was being undertaken at its sibling institution, the Royal Ontario Museum. This work also entailed the demolition of part of the Planetarium's facilities. Though attendance picked up when the adjacent Museum reopened in 1984, the Planetarium was forced to close on November 5, 1995, due to provincial budget cuts to the Museum. The Planetarium's exhibits, artifacts and theatre facilities were subsequently dismantled and dispersed. For a brief period it housed the Children's Own Museum. It is now used solely for offices and as a storage facility for the Museum. Early in 2009 the R.O.M. announced that it had sold the building and site to the University of Toronto, who plan to demolish the existing building to make way for additional facilities.</description>

            <description>, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (lit. Municipal Museum Amsterdam) is a museum for classic modern and contemporary art in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. It has been housed on the Paulus Potterstraat, next to Museum Square Museumplein and to the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum and the Concertgebouw, in Amsterdam Zuid since 1895. The original red brick, Neo-Renaissance style building was designed by architect Adriaan Willem Weissman. The collection contains some 90,000 objects from a variety of disciplines. Highlights of the collection include The Beanery by Edward Kienholz and works by Kazimir Malevich, Bauhaus and De Stijl. Since 1909, the Stedelijk has been devoted to collecting thought-provoking contemporary art, later augmenting its collection with photography and design objects. In the course of the last century, the Stedelijk Museum became renowned as one of the world’s most influential museums for twentieth-century art. The collection rivals that of the Centre Pompidou and MoMA. Since its inception, the Stedelijk Museum has consistently reflected new currents and developments in art and design in both its exhibition and acquisitions policy. Today, education is a prominent aspect of museum policy, which is evident from the Stedelijk’s emphasis on innovative and classic modern presentations. The Bertolt Brecht quotation ‘It is democratic to turn ‘the small circle of connoisseurs’ into a large circle of connoisseurs’ embodies the Stedelijk’s vision.</description>

            <address>East Bank, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis</address>
            <description>The Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum located on the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis has been a teaching museum for the university since 1934. The museum's current building, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry, was completed in 1993. The stainless steel skin was fabricated and installed by the A. Zahner Company, a frequent collaborator with Gehry's office. It is one of the major landmarks on campus, situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. The building presents two faces, depending on which side it is viewed from. From the campus side, it presents a brick facade that blends with the existing brick and sandstone buildings. On the opposite side, the museum is a playground of curving and angular brushed steel sheets. This side is an abstraction of a waterfall and a fish. The most stunning views of the building are from the pedestrian and highway decks of the adjacent Washington Avenue Bridge. Some locals critical of the radical architectural style frequently point out that the building's design could unexpectedly reflect the light of the sun into the eyes of motorists on the bridge. Studies commissioned by MNDOT have found that the museum is not hazardous to motorists. Often called a &quot;modern art museum,&quot; the 20,000+ image collection has large collections of Marsden Hartley, Alfred Maurer, Charles Biederman, Native American Mimbres culture pottery, and Korean furniture. A new addition, also designed by Gehry, was expected to open in 2009. However, due to economic conditions, construction did not begin until the spring of 2010. The Weisman closed its doors on Sunday, October 10, 2010 until the fall of 2011 as a part of this major expansion. The Weisman's five new galleries will allow the museum to share more than three times as many objects from the permanent collection at any given time. One new gallery will be filled with highlights from their noted ceramics collection (master potter Warren MacKenzie will help select the work); two will house masterworks of American modernism; and another will showcase the Weisman's considerable collection of photography, prints, and drawings. The fifth new gallery, the Target Studio for Creative Collaboration, will house experimental collaborations between artists and students, faculty, and the community. The museum is named for Frederick R. Weisman, a Minneapolis native who became well known as an art collector in Los Angeles. He died in 1994. There is another Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art on the campus of Pepperdine University in Malibu, California. Additionally, there is the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation, the Los Angeles estate designed to serve as a showcase for his personal collection of 20th-century art. When he opened the art collection at his Los Angeles estate to the public, he wanted to share the experience of living with art – rather than the usual, more formal protocol of seeing art in a gallery or museum. The Weisman Foundation estate, located in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles, is a two-story Mediterranean Revival house designed in the late 1920’s by Los Angeles architect Gordon B. Kaufmann. The Weisman home exhibits the fine craftsmanship characteristic of the period, including custom decorative treatments on the walls and ceilings. Today the Foundation estate, annex, and surrounding gardens is made accessible to the public by appointment only on guided tours..</description>

            <description>The Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, housed in its festive palatial building on Ringstraße, crowned with an octagonal dome, is one of the premier museums of fine arts and decorative arts in the world. The term Kunsthistorisches Museum applies to both the institution and the main building. It was visited by 619,318 people in 2007. It was opened in 1891 at the same time as the Naturhistorisches Museum, by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary. The two museums have identical exteriors and face each other across Maria-Theresien-Platz. Both buildings were built between 1872 and 1891 according to plans drawn up by Gottfried Semper and Karl Freiherr von Hasenauer. The two Ringstraße museums were commissioned by the Emperor in order to find a suitable shelter for the Habsburgs' formidable art collection and to make it accessible to the general public. The façade was built of sandstone. The building is rectangular in shape, and topped with a dome that is 60 meters high. The inside of the building is lavishly decorated with marble, stucco ornamentations, gold-leaf, and paintings, making it a spectacular work of art in its own right.</description>

But one devoted to teaching, exhibiting and producing the newest of the new in media art does not exist in the United States. 'It's an historical opportunity,' said John S. Johnson, 35, co-founder of Eyebeam and an heir of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson family. &quot; In an article in Chelsea Now, Kelly Kingman writes &quot;Eyebeam is not your conventional gallery. In [the 2007 exhibition] “Source Code,” the first of three exhibits commemorating Eyebeam’s 10th anniversary on the frontier of the digital world. The work here represents artists, programmers, hackers, activists, youth — the kind of people Eyebeam welcomes into its creative laboratories, where innovators of all stripes come to come test their ideas. ... While Eyebeam definitely “celebrates the hack,” as its website states, the research groups that are constantly in progress go beyond culture jamming. “A lot of the work here is process-based, it’s work in progress. ” says [Amanda McDonald] Crowley [Executive Director of Eyebeam since October 2005]. “We’re quite happy to show we’re not a neat gallery environment but a place where people are making work and there’s a lot of activity going on. ”&quot;</description>

            <description>The Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées, commonly known as the Grand Palais, is a large historic site, [[exhibition hall] and museum complex located at the Champs-Élysées in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, France. Construction of the Grand Palais began in 1897 following the demolition of the Palais de l’Industrie (Palace of the Industry) as part of the preparation works for the Universal Exposition of 1900, which also included the creation of the adjacent Petit Palais and Pont Alexandre III. The structure was built in the style of Beaux-Arts architecture as taught by the École des Beaux-Arts of Paris. The building reflects the movement's taste for ornate decoration through its stone facades, the formality of its floor planning and the use of techniques that were innovative at the time, such as its glass vault, its structure made of iron and light steel framing, and its use of reinforced concrete.</description>

            <description>The State Tretyakov Gallery is an art gallery in Moscow, Russia, the foremost depository of Russian fine art in the world. The gallery's history starts in 1856 when the Moscow merchant Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov acquired works by Russian artists of his day with the aim of creating a collection, which might later grow into a museum of national art. In 1892, Tretyakov presented his already famous collection to the Russian nation. The façade of the gallery building was designed by the painter Viktor Vasnetsov in a peculiar Russian fairy-tale style. It was built in 1902–04 to the south from the Moscow Kremlin. During the 20th century, the gallery expanded to several neighboring buildings, including the 17th-century church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi. The collection contains more than 130,000 exhibits, ranging from Theotokos of Vladimir and Andrei Rublev's Trinity to the monumental Composition VII by Wassily Kandinsky and the Black Square by Kazimir Malevich. In 1977 the Gallery kept a significant part of the George Costakis collection.</description>

            <description>The Museum für Naturkunde, officially the Museum für Naturkunde - Leibniz-Institut für Evolutions- und Biodiversitätsforschung an der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin or Naturkundemuseum (Natural History Museum), occasionally known as the Humboldt Museum, is a natural history museum in Berlin, Germany. Usually the museum's name is abbreviated MFN, but other shorts are common in the older literature, too. The museum houses a massive collection of more than 30 million zoological, paleontological, and minerological specimens, including more than ten thousand type specimens. It is most famous for two spectacular exhibits: the largest mounted dinosaur in the world, and the most exquisitely preserved specimen of the earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx. This is the largest museum of natural history in Germany, and was established in 1810. Its collections contain objects from three major fields, paleontology, mineralogy, and zoology. The museum's mineral collections date back as early as to the Prussian Academy in 1700. Significant zoological specimens were recovered for example by the German deep-sea Valdiva expedition (1898–99), by the German Southpolar Expedition (1901–03), and by the German Sunda Expedition (1929–31). Expeditions to fossil beds in Tendaguru in former Deutsch Ostafrika unearthed rich paleontological treasures. The collections are so extensive that less than 1 in 5000 specimens is actually exhibited, and they attract researchers from around the world. Additional exhibits include a mineral collection representing 75% of the minerals in the world, a large meteor collection, the largest piece of amber in the world; exhibits of the now-extinct quagga and tasmanian tiger, and &quot;Bobby&quot; the gorilla, a Berlin Zoo celebrity from the 1920s and 1930s.</description>

            <address>Dundee, Scotland</address>
            <description>McManus Galleries is a Gothic Revival-style building, located in the centre of Dundee, Scotland. The building houses a museum and art gallery with a collection of fine and decorative art as well as a natural history collection. The concept for the building was originally commissioned as a memorial to Prince Albert and intended to contain room for lectures, museum, picture gallery and a reference library for students by British Association for the Advancement of Science. The funding for the building was agreed to be provided by the inhabitants of Dundee. Although the city could not afford such a lavish memorial outright, it did contribute £300. A guaranteed fund of £4,205 15/- from 168 contributors was collected which included a munificent gift from the Baxter family which totalled £420. The building was designed by the architect George Gilbert Scott, who was an expert for the restoration of mediaeval churches and advocate of the Gothic architectural style. He intended to design a large tower like in his previous work at St. Nikolai, Hamburg. The foundations were situated in a small wetland called Quaw Bog at the confluence of the Scourin Burn and Friar Burn, which has since been drained. This meant that the area under the building site was underpinned by large wood beams. However, when construction began in 1865, the ground proved too unstable to support the larger tower that he envisaged. The building was opened as the Albert Institute in 1867. Two further sections, which extended the building by four art galleries and four museum galleries, were added by 1889. The central section was designed to Scott's intention by David MacKenzie, with the Eastern Galleries by William Alexander. The contents of the Watt Institute, founded in 1848, were incorporated into the collection before the opening of the civic museum and art gallery in 1873. Between 1873 and 1949, the buildings were administrated as part of public library service. From 1959, the city corporation took over the running of the administration. Ironically, following a later refurbishment the building now commemorates the Lord Provost Maurice McManus. In 1976, cracks were discovered in south-east corner of the building. The subsequent survey found that the building was partially subsiding. During 1979, remedial measures of placing load bearing concrete piles and cross-beams positioned to replace rotted timbers. The building was closed to the public on October 24, 2005 for a £7.8million redevelopment and will be reopened to the public on February 28 2010. Currently, much of the McManus collection, which includes works by Dundee-based artists James MacIntosh Patrick and Alberto Morrocco, is located at the former Carnegie Library on Barrack Street.</description>

The museum moved to a new site at 215 Centre Street in 2009. It increased in size by sixfold, in a space that was designed by architect Maya Lin.</description>

            <description>The Churchill War Rooms is a museum in London and one of the five branches of the Imperial War Museum. The museum comprises the Cabinet War Rooms, a historic underground complex that housed a British government command centre throughout the Second World War, and the Churchill Museum, a biographical museum exploring the life of British statesman Winston Churchill. As a branch of a national museum, the Churchill War Rooms is supported by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, by admissions income and the museum's commercial activity. Construction of the Cabinet War Rooms, located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, began in 1938. They became operational in August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of war in Europe. They remained in operation throughout the Second World War, before being abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. After the war the historic value of the Cabinet War Rooms was recognised. Their preservation became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works and later the Department for the Environment, during which time very limited numbers of the public were able to visit by appointment. In the early 1980s the Imperial War Museum was asked to take over the administration of the site, and the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public in April 1984. The museum was reopened in 2005 following a major redevelopment, as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms but in 2010 this was shortened to the Churchill War Rooms.</description>

            <description>The Figge Art Museum is an art museum in Davenport, Iowa. The Figge, as it is commonly known, has an encyclopedic collection and serves as the major art museum for the eastern Iowa and western Illinois region. The Figge works closely with several regional universities and colleges (see below) as an art resource and collections hub for a number of higher education programs. The museum opened on August 6, 2005, and is the re-named successor to the Davenport Museum of Art, which was opened on October 10, 1925, as the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery. The museum has its roots in the Davenport Art Association, which was founded before February 23, 1878, and was re-located on November 15, 1889, to the Bianca Wheeler art studio. The Figge Art Museum is one of the oldest art institutions in the country and is considered the first municipal art gallery in the United States. The Figge won an AIA award. The new building was designed by Stirling Prize winning Modernist British architect David Chipperfield. The Figge Art Museum gets its name from the V.O. and Elizabeth Kahl Figge Foundation, which donated $13 million towards its $47 million construction. The Figge family, a local banking family of Swiss origin, has a long tradition of philanthropy and cultural enrichment. The first pieces of its collections were donated by Davenport community leader Charles Ficke (1850–1931), a successful lawyer and former mayor, who collected art from around the world. Robert E. Harsche, then Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, reported that to his knowledge no American public art gallery had &quot;started out with so large a number of important paintings as a nucleus.&quot;</description>

The museum is a fine arts museum, but does not take the concept of a usual fine arts museum. With many features that are child-oriented and a sprawling and occasionally mazelike interior, the museum is a playfully created place. Centered around the motto appearing on the museum's website &quot;Let's become lost children together&quot; (迷子になろうよ、いっしょに, Maigo ni narō yo, isshoni), or 'let's lose our way together' as it is translated in the English leaflet. It has no set path or order of viewing. While the museum brochure contains a variety of languages, the signs within the museum are in Japanese only.</description>

The center was opened to the public in a ceremony in March 2001, attended by President George W. Bush, several cardinals, members of Congress and other dignitaries. The Center's original purpose was to explore the intersection of faith and culture through interactive displays, academic discussion and research, and museum exhibits. It has gone through several periods of difficulty and layoffs, with the most recent in May 2006 seeing the dismissal of almost 90% of its staff, and in June 2006, the replacement of its second executive director in less than two years. The Cultural Center is now in a period of reorganization, abandoning its art museum and emphasizing its original goal of exploring faith and culture in an academic context. Pope Benedict XVI met with about 200 representatives of Islam, Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Judaism at the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center on April 17, 2008.</description>

            <description>The Telus World of Science - Edmonton is a broad-based science centre in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, operated by the Edmonton Space &amp;amp; Science Foundation. The centre is located on the southwest corner of Coronation Park in the neighbourhood of Woodcroft. The centre first opened in 1984, as a replacement for the Queen Elizabeth Planetarium located to the east that had operated as Edmonton's Planetarium since 1960 but had become limited by its 65 seating capacity. The City of Edmonton selected the Edmonton Space Sciences Centre as the City's flagship project commemorating the Province of Alberta's 75th Anniversary. The original building was designed by architect Douglas J. Cardinal.. When first opened, it was called the Edmonton Space Science Centre and then later it was changed to the Edmonton Space and Science Centre. In 2001, after a 14-million dollar expansion to the original building, the name was changed again to the Odyssium. On May 2, 2005, the center was renamed to the Telus World of Science - Edmonton after a $8.2 million, 20-year partnership with Telus.. The centre attracts over half a million visitors a year and has Canada's largest planetarium dome theatre (the Margaret Zeidler Star Theatre). There are currently plans in the works for another expansion that would see the center triple in size. The expansion would include a new DVT (Digital Visualization Theatre), new galleries, a restaurant and, through a partnership with the University of Alberta, a research facility that would allow ideas to be tested and modified.</description>

            <description>The Children’s Museum of Manhattan was founded by Bette Korman, under the name GAME (Growth Through Art and Museum Education), in 1973. With New York City in a deep fiscal crisis, and school art, music, and cultural programs eliminated, a loosely organized, group of artists and educators set up a basement storefront to serve Harlem and the Upper West Side. With a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, a city-owned courthouse was renovated into a small exhibition, studio, and workshop and renamed the Manhattan Laboratory Museum. The museum became the Children’s Museum of Manhattan in the 1980s and moved to its current location on West 83rd Street in 1989. Its audience has grown to 325,000 visitors each year, which includes 30,000 children who visit as part of a school group and more than 34,000 children served through offsite outreach programs.</description>

            <description>The Billings Estate Museum is an Ottawa museum located in the former home of one of the region's earliest settlers. The house was built in 1828 by Massachusetts born Braddish Billings. It is Ottawa's oldest surviving house, though the Bytown Museum building is older. Billings had moved to the area in 1812, and was the first settler in Gloucester Township. Billings became prosperous in the timber trade, and built the large home that was named Park Hill. Billings later moved into agriculture, and the house became the centre of a large and prosperous farm providing produce for Bytown, with the farm linked to town by the Bytown and Prescott Railway. The estate remained in the Billings family until 1975. Over time the property was slowly sold off to developers, and today the estate retains only a relatively small plot of land. In 1975 the house became a museum which is today operated by the city of Ottawa.</description>

In 2006, the museum's expansion designed by architects at PGAV, featured a 'green' building, which also served as an environmental exhibit. The Center's virtual library, created in 2001 at a time when this technology was still evolving, allowed museum visitors to link with the local public libraries in real time to further understand the exhibits on view. The Center's use of videoconferencing as an outreach tool has been used as a model for adoption and teaching tool.</description>

The Bagatti Valsecchi Museum’s permanent collections principally contain Italian Renaissance decorative arts, some sculptures (including a Madonna and Child lunette by a follower of Donatello), and many paintings. European Renaissance weapons, armor, clocks and a few textiles and scientific and musical instruments complete the collection assembled by the Barons Bagatti Valsecchi.</description>

            <description>Battalion Park is the site of a set of geoglyphs located in Calgary, Alberta on Signal Hill. The site is located on a hill overlooking the Sarcee Nation, and lands formerly known as Camp Sarcee and later Sarcee Training Area. This region, in the valley of the Elbow River, was a military reserve used from before the First World War and up until the 1990s by the Canadian Forces. The park itself consists of a stairway up the hill with several interpretative displays. The centrepiece of the park, however are large whitewashed stones, arranged on the side of the hill to spell out several numerals. The numerals correspond to the numbers of four battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force who trained in the region before embarking for combat deployment overseas during World War I. The numerals were created by 16,000 stones hauled in sacks by hand from the river by soldiers in their off duty time. After the war, the numerals fell into disrepair and became overgrown and forgotten until a local historian looked for them prior to grading of the hill to accommodate construction in the area. Following extensive lobbying to declare the numbers a historic site, a project initiated by several cadet groups in Calgary restored the numerals.

            <address>Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</address>
            <description>The Canadian Ski Museum is a museum in Ottawa, Ontario, located upstairs in the Trailhead building on Scott Street. It was founded in 1971 by a dedicated group of volunteers and ski enthusiasts. Shortly thereafter, in 1975 the museum was incorporated. The museum’s founders recognized the rapid expansion and development of the sport of skiing over the years; this inspired them to collect not only the material and artifacts related to skiing, but also the various stories associated with the early years. These artifacts and stories remain to be the foundation from which the museum has built its world-class collection. Upon the museum's opening, Herman 'Jackrabbit' Smith-Johannsen http://www. skimuseum. ca/biodata. php?lang=en&amp;amp;id=123 acted as the Patron of the Canadian Ski Museum, and donated several of his prize possessions to the collection. Within the museum exhibit is an area devoted to ‘Jackrabbit’, the protagonist and practitioner of cross country and wilderness skiing who lived and breathed skiing for 111 years of his legendary life. The Canadian Ski Museum’s unparalleled collection of artifacts and archival holdings are a priceless part of Canadian cultural heritage. Since the Museum’s beginnings, the collection has continued to grow, and the presentations of displays and stories about the history of skiing in Canada have increased. The museum has an incredible collection of photographs, memorabilia, skis, poles and ski clothing donated by skiers, all devoted to preserving the memory of Canada's skiing past. At present, volunteers supported by a small paid staff, carry out the Museum’s activities. The Museum relies on the support of friends and donors to continue to preserve and present Canadian Ski Heritage. The Canadian Ski Museum established the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1982 http://www. skimuseum. ca/famealpha. php?lang=en. Since the creation of the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame over 140 people have been inducted. The Canadian Ski Hall of Fame honours the pioneers, competitors, builders and industry personnel that have contributed significantly to Canada’s skiing/snowboarding heritage. The Canadian Ski Museum is a registered Canadian Charity and governed by a Board of Directors, operating through the Chair of the Board and an Executive Committee. The Canadian Ski Museum is recognized by the Fédération Internationale de Ski (&quot;FIS&quot;) the International Ski Federation.</description>

            <description>The Holy Jesus Hospital is a museum and tourist attraction in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in the care of the National Trust. The site of the hospital has been in use for 700 years helping the townspeople, and this history is explained by the museum currently on the site. There was an Augustinian Friary on the site from the thirteenth century, then a hospital or almshouse for housing retired freemen, then a soup kitchen in the nineteenth century, before the site acquired its current function as a museum. The museum also serves as the basis of the Inner City Project of the National Trust. The Inner City Project takes people of ages 12–25 and over 50 out to the countryside in order to increase appreciation of the city's natural surroundings. The building is of architectural interest because it still retains architectural elements from many previous centuries, including a thirteenth century sacristy wall and 16th century fortifications connected with the King's Council of the North. It is also one of only two intact 17th century brick buildings that survive in the city, the other being Alderman Fenwick's House.</description>

Few people in Nottingham are aware of this labyrinth, which exists underneath the city streets, and fewer still have visited them. Nottingham has more man-made caves than anywhere else in Britain. People have worked and lived in them for over 1,000 years. ” The attraction has been run by the Galleries of Justice since 2004 and is accessed from the upper mall of the Broadmarsh Shopping Centre.</description>

            <description>The National Museum of the Marine Corps is the new historical museum of the United States Marine Corps. It is located in Quantico, Virginia and is free to the public. The museum had its grand opening on November 10, 2006 and is now the number one tourist attraction in Virginia, drawing over 500,000 people annually. On the day it was opened, President George W. Bush came to give a dedication and to also present the family of fallen Marine Jason Dunham the Medal of Honor. President Bush: &quot;These walls remind all who visit here that honor, courage, and commitment are not just words. They are core values for a way of life that puts service above self. And these walls will keep the history of the Marine Corps alive for generations of Americans to come. &quot; Designed by Curtis W. Fentress, FAIA, RIBA of Fentress Architects, the exterior design is meant to &quot;evoke the image of the flag raisers of Iwo Jima,&quot; an image that is also preserved by the USMC War Memorial. The 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m) museum is a tribute to the U.S. Marines who have served their country since 1775. The new museum replaces the Marine Corps Historical Center, in the Washington Navy Yard, which closed 1 July 2005, and the Marine Corps Air-Ground Museum, in Quantico, Virginia, which closed on 15 November 2002. The museum is a public-private venture, a cooperative effort of the United States Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation. The Foundation manages the museum operation, while the museum building will be donated to the Marine Corps.</description>

The center opened in April 1997 as part of the redevelopment in downtown Augusta. In late 2003, the state cut off funds to the center and Fort Discovery was at danger of closing. In early 2004, the city and community funded Fort Discovery until January 2005, when the state started funding the center once more. File:Portal-puzzle. svg State of Georgia portal</description>

            <description>RAAF Wagga Heritage Centre (Originally known as the Wagga Wagga RAAF Museum but was officially, RAAF Museum – Wagga Annex) is a heritage centre located at the Wagga Wagga RAAF Base at Forest Hill located approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia on the Sturt Highway. The heritage centre has indoor and outdoor displays of aircraft, memorabilia and photographs relating to the RAAF in the Riverina. The museum was closed in 2001 for refurbishment with the memorabilia temporarily relocated to the Point Cook RAAF museum but plans to reopen the museum were quietly scrapped after the RAAF adopted a new policy in 2003, which stated that the RAAF would only fund Point Cook RAAF museum. AirCare and Wagga Wagga based newspaper The Daily Advertiser ran a campaign during late September and early October 2008 in an attempt to reverse the Australian Defence Force's decision. On 13 December 2008, it was announced that the museum will be reopening in 2009. The Air Force would spend A$75,000 completing the refurbishment of the museum building, due to be complete in 2009 sometime. In May 2009, a public consultation meeting was held to discuss plans for the centre, including the A$130,000 set aside by the Royal Australian Air Force for outfitting the building for a future heritage display. On 12 March 2010, it was reported that the heritage centre is expected to reopen in Spring 2010, but the official opening date was yet to be announced. On 29 July 2010, Air Marshal Mark Binskin announced at the RAAF Base Wagga 70th anniversary that the heritage centre will open on 15 October 2010. The heritage centre was officially opened on the 12 October 2010 and will opened three days a week.</description>

            <description>Great Explorations Children's Museum (formerly Great Explorations - The Hands-On Museum) is a children's museum, program center, and pre-school in St Petersburg, Florida, USA. It was founded in 1986 by The Junior League of St. Petersburg and Hands-On, Inc. Great Explorations - The Hands-On Museum was formerly housed in a warehouse type location in Downtown St. Petersburg with similar building architecture to the Salvador Dalí Museum and P. Buckley Moss Museum. It's parking lot featured a to-scale replica of a Tyrannosaurus rex made entirely out of recycled scrap metal. Inside, the exhibits were divided into large, themed rooms with individual rooms being devoted to sight, sound, or touch exhibits. The touch room featured one of the more unique exhibits, the &quot;Touch Tunnel&quot;. This  Convert/LoffAoffDbSmid, completely blacked out tunnel encouraged children to navigate the fun house-like path using only their sense of touch. The original museum also had a small branch located in a hallway of the St. Petersburg Pier that included smaller versions of some of the museum's popular exhibits. Eventually, the museum was taken over by new management and was moved to its current location adjacent to the re-opened and refurbished Sunken Gardens. At this time, the name was also changed to Great Explorations Children's Museum dropping the &quot;Hands-On&quot; title. Designs for the new museum included more offices and school rooms as the museum intended to expand out their staffing and education capabilities. The museum also petitioned for and was given a grant from AmeriCorps and currently employs 13 AmeriCorps members on staff.</description>

Renowned playwright and short-story writer Anton Chekhov played a major role in establishing the collection of his home city through his connections in St. Petersburg Academy of Arts and his friends like Mark Antokolski etc. The most important part of the museum collection was formed in the Soviet Union time, and features two departments - Russian art before the Russian Revolution of 1917 and Soviet art. The whole collection of art was looted from the museum during the Occupation of Taganrog in 1941-1943. Since 1975, the museum of art is located at the former mansion of merchant Anton Handrin on Alexandrovskaya street 56.</description>

            <address>Sherbrooke Street East, Montreal, Quebec in Canada.</address>
            <description>, the Château Dufresne was originally divided into two separate households, one for each brother. The founding fathers of the city of Maisonneuve - now incorporated with the city of Montreal - the famous Dufresne brothers were wealthy twentieth century French Canadian entrepreneurs who played a major role in the history of Montreal. Now used as an historical museum showcasing the Beaux-Arts architecture and antique furnishings of the former Dufresne residences, the Chateau Dufresne was declared an historic monument by the provincial government in 1976. Designed by the Parisian architect Jules Renard who based his plans on the Petit Trianon in Versailles, France, the Dufresne mansion was an ambitious project from the get-go. Constructed from 1915 to 1918, the interior of this Gothic-inspired mansion was decorated with a series of beautiful murals and ceiling paintings by Guido Nincheri in the 1920s. Known for his piety and devout religious leanings, the secular subject matter of the Château Dufresne's interior decor is an amazing exception to the rest of Nincheri's artistic career. Having served as the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts from 1979 to 1997, the Chateau Dufresne now offers tours of the mansion and also plays host to various temporary art and history exhibitions.</description>

            <address>Warsaw, Poland</address>
            <description>Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom is a museum in Warsaw, Poland. It is a branch of the Museum of Independence. The museum presents the conditions in which Polish patriots and resistance fighters were jailed by Nazi Germany during World War II. The museum is located on the Szucha Avenue, in the building of the pre-war Ministry of Religious Beliefs and Public Enlightement (now the Ministry of National Education). After the outbreak of World War II, the Nazis took over the building and turned it into the headquarters of the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst police forces. The whole street was closed to Poles. In the basement of the building, the Nazis set up rough jails. Prisoners who were located there were usually freshly caught or transferred from Pawiak prison. Prisoners were subject to brutal interrogations, during which they were tortured and severely beaten. Torture was no exception for any prisoner, and even pregnant women were beaten and tortured. Polish prisoners often scratched out some sentences about beatings into the prison walls. Many of these inscriptions were also personal, patriotic or religious. In the 1960s a research was conducted, and over 1,000 texts were conserved. The most famous of them is the following: &amp;lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 4em; font-style: italic;&quot;&amp;gt; It is easy to speak about Poland. It is harder to work for her. Even harder to die for her. And the hardest to suffer for her. &amp;lt;/poem&amp;gt; Many of the prisoners were killed during interrogations or died as a result of their injuries. During the Warsaw Uprising, Germans mass executed thousands of Poles in the surrounding areas. Their corpses were later burned in neighbouring buildings. The extent of these killings were tremendous, human ashes found in the basement after the war weighed 5,578.5 kg (12,298 lb). After the war the people of Warsaw treated the place as a cemetery, often bringing flowers and lighting candles. In July 1946 the Polish government decided to designate the site as a place of martyrdom, a testament to the suffering and heroism of the Poles. It was decided that the jails will remain untouched and turned into a museum. It was opened on 18 April 1952. Hallways, four group cells and ten solitary cells were preserved in their original condition. In accordance with the testimonies of prisoners, a room of a Gestapo officer was recreated. Several tons of human ashes were relocated to the Warsaw Insurgents Cemetery. Admission into the museum is free, though visitors must be at least 14 years old.</description>

            <description>The Connecticut River Museum is a U.S. educational and cultural institution based at Steamboat Dock in Essex, Connecticut that focuses on the marine environment and maritime heritage of the Connecticut River Valley. The three-story Connecticut River Museum is located in a restored 1878 steamboat warehouse. The museum opened to the public in 1975, with Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso as its first paid member and ex officio patron. The core of its collection came from the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, which provided the museum with a loan of nautical artwork, navigation equipment and maritime-related artifacts. The museum's main and third levels offer changing exhibits, while its second level is home to a permanent exhibition on shipbuilding, which includes historical maps and models of steamboats and exhibits on the piscine species in the Connecticut River. The museum's collection also includes a full-scale replica of Turtle, the first American submarine, which was constructed in Essex in 1776 for use against the British in the American Revolution. The museum property also includes a boathouse and a research library. In December 1995, the museum was given a triangular one-acre waterfront property, valued at US$910,000, in the neighboring village of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, by Bill and Victoria Winterer, who were among the museums co-founders. The property is used as a waterfront park managed by the museum. The Connecticut River Museum also operates the RiverQuest, the 54-foot twin-hull tour boat which is moored next to the museum. The RiverQuest provides tours of the lower Connecticut River, where the wetlands have been recognized by The Nature Conservancy, a U.S. nonprofit environmental organization, as &quot;one of the last great places in the Northern Hemisphere. &quot; RiverQuest conducts makes 90-minute trips throughout the year, along with two-hour sunset cruises in during summer and eagle-sighting excursions in February.</description>

It is built in a niche at the eastern edge of the rock and most of it lies beneath the level of the hilltop, making it largely invisible. It was considered one of the major archaeological museums in Athens. Due to its limited size, the Greek Government decided in the late 1980s to build a new museum. The New Acropolis Museum is now built at the foot of the Acropolis. In June 2007 the old museum closed its doors so that its antiquities could be moved to their new home, which opened on 20 June 2009.</description>

Its current address is 1 Grantham Street, in the south end of the main CBD of Hamilton, where it has been based since 1987. It sits on land gifted to the Hamilton City Council by the Tainui Tribe, and there is a strong Tainui presence in the museum. Previously the museum was based in London Street. The museum has twelve galleries that exhibit long-term and touring exhibitions. Displays include a 200 year old carved Waka Taua (a Maori war canoe, Te Winika), artworks by regional and other New Zealand artists, and science exhibits. Controversy has surrounded the museum, from its inception in 1987, to its continued move towards the new concepts of edutainment and interactive exhibits. Presently there is a balance between the different types of exhibits.</description>

            <description>The Florence Air &amp;amp; Missile Museum was an aviation museum which was located at the entrance to the Florence Regional Airport, in Florence, South Carolina. This airport was original known as Florence Field, a World War II U.S. Army Air Corps training field for A-26 Invader attack aircraft. Because of its former military connection, and available runways, the military was able to fly in aircraft and leave them at the Museum as they were retired from service. The museum was founded by Tommy Griffin, a former B-29 mechanic who served in the Pacific theater during World War II and former executive director of the airport. The museum built up a collection of World War II and Cold War era U.S. military aircraft and early space hardware. The museum was located along a route once frequented by travels between Florence and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Once Interstate was built, attendance declined. The museum closed in December 1997 and much of the collection transferred to the newly established Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina.</description>

            <address>1934 Poplar Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee</address>
            <description>Memphis Brooks Museum of Art is an art museum in Memphis, Tennessee. The Brooks Museum, which was founded in 1916, is the oldest and largest art museum in the state of Tennessee. The museum is a privately funded nonprofit institution located in Overton Park in Midtown Memphis. The original Beaux-Arts building, a registered U.S. National Landmark designed by James Gamble Rogers in 1913, was donated by Bessie Vance Brooks in memory of her husband, Samuel Hamilton Brooks. The cylindrical extension, opened in 1955, was designed by Memphis architect Everett Woods. The Brooks’ facilities also include the Brooks Museum Store, the Brushmark Restaurant, the Holly Court garden, and a grand terrace that overlooks the greens and trees of Overton Park. In 1989, the building was expanded and reoriented by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The expansion, which doubled the square footage of the existing building, included a new public entrance as well as a three-story gallery space where the old and new buildings join. The facility consists of 29 galleries, art classrooms, a print study room with over 4,500 works of art on paper, a research library with over 5,000 volumes, and an auditorium. The collection has over seven thousand works of art, including paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, and examples of the decorative arts. Of particular note are the Samuel H. Kress Collection of Renaissance and Baroque paintings, the Hugo N. Dixon Collection of Impressionist paintings, the Levy Collection of American prints, the Goodman Book Collection, and the Goodheart Collection of Carl Gutherz paintings, drawings, and archival material.</description>

            <description>The National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. The collection was begun after World War I, and the museum was officially opened in 1942. The museum has collections totalling about 100,000 objects, most of which are antiquities and medieval finds from excavations undertaken by the Directorate General of Antiquities. About 1300 artifacts are exhibited, ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. During the 1975 Lebanese Civil War, the museum stood on the front line that separated the warring factions. The museum's Egyptian Revival building and its collection suffered extensive damage in the war, but most of the artifacts were saved by last-minute pre-emptive measures. Today, after a major renovation, the National Museum of Beirut has regained its former position, especially as a leading collector for ancient Phoenician objects.</description>

            <description>The Vancouver Police Museum (formerly Vancouver Police Centennial Museum) opened to commemorate the centennial of the Vancouver Police Department and the City of Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986. Located at 240 E. Cordova Street in Vancouver's Gastown, the museum is housed in a building that was once both the Coroner’s Court and autopsy facilities (until 1980) and the City Analyst’s laboratory (until 1996). It was designed by architect Arthur J. Bird, and today it is a municipally designated heritage building. The museum is run by the Vancouver Police Historical Society, a non-profit organization established in 1983 with the mandate to foster interest in the history of the Vancouver Police Department and to open a museum for this purpose. The catalyst for the project was the museum's first curator, Joe Swan, a former police sergeant and amateur historian. Swan wrote the department's official history book, which was published by the Vancouver Historical Society in 1986, entitled, A Century of Service: The Vancouver Police, 1886-1986. The museum houses a collection of approximately 20,000 objects. This includes archival documents, photographs, publications, confiscated firearms and other weapons, counterfeit currency, and a various other artifacts and memorabilia, of which an estimated 40% is on display. The museum offers educational programs for children and walking tours of the neighbourhood on the theme, &quot;Sins of the City. &quot; The museum has a gift shop and publishes a quarterly newsletter. The museum is self-funded through admission and program fees, membership fees, donations, gift shop sales, and project grants; the museum receives no direct funding from the Vancouver Police Department or the City of Vancouver but does receive in-kind support.</description>

            <address>Frogner, Oslo</address>
            <description>The Vigeland Museum is a museum in Oslo, Norway. Its history began in 1919 when noted sculptor Gustav Vigeland made an offer to Oslo Municipality to donate his works sometime in the future. Vigeland's total body of works consisted not only of sculptures, but also woodcuts, drawings, sketches and photographs as well as letters, other writings and a personal library. In return, Vigeland wanted an atelier. The atelier could be rebuilt as a museum after his death. Even Vigeland's flat on the third floor was preserved as a part of the museum. The building of the would-be museum commenced in 1921, as soon as a contract between Vigeland and Oslo had been formalized. The architects were Lorentz Harboe Ree and Carl Buch, and the style was neo-classic. In 1923 Vigeland moved in, one year before the middle part and northern wing were completed. The southern wing was completed in 1930. The atelier was used by both Vigeland and other artists. Vigeland died in 1943, during the hard economic times of World War II. The building was opened as a public museum in 1947, partially thanks to budget surplus from the municipal cinema company Oslo Kinematografer. The museum is still owned by Oslo municipality via its etat of culture, and the current museum director is Jarle Strømodden. Immediately north of the museum is the more famous Vigeland Sculpture Park&amp;mdash;which showcases Vigeland's larger statues and sculptures&amp;mdash;and the Frogner Park. The highway Ring 2 runs nearby, and buses as well as Oslo Tramway provide for public transportation. The museum is within reasonable walking distance of the stations Frogner plass on the Frogner Line, and, further away, Nobels gate on the Skøyen Line (the now-closed station Halvdan Svartes gate was proximate as well).</description>

            <address>West Henderson's Wynd, Blackness, Dundee</address>
            <description>Verdant Works is a former jute mill in the Blackness area of Dundee. It was purchased in 1991 by Dundee Heritage Trust who restored the buildings, opening them in 1996 as a museum dedicated to textile industry that once dominated the city's economy. It is still possible to get some sense of how important jute was to Dundee by visiting Verdant Works. The only dedicated Jute Museum in the UK. Located in the city's Blackness area Verdant Works is an 'A' listed building, the highest category for listing in Scotland and denoting a building of national architectural importance. It is a rare surviving example of a courtyard-type mill with its original building layout and many original features remaining. The building in which the museum is located and the collection held is one of a rapidly reducing number of industrial premises in Dundee and east central Scotland which survives little changed from the 19th century. As a museum Verdant Works tells the story of Dundee's textile industries, focusing primarily on the jute and linen industries. The production of textiles was the dominant industry in Dundee for many years. At the end of the 19th century the industry directly employed some 50,000 people in the city (half the working population) plus many more thousands in associated trades such as shipbuilding, transportation and engineering. This is a unique situation in Scotland's industrial history. Dundee supplied the majority of the world's demand for jute products and this widens the story into one that has great importance for Scottish and indeed British history. The jute collections cover the entire history of the jute industry and relate to topics such as manufacturing, research and development, the end products, quality control, textile engineering, the industry's Indian connections and the lives of the workers. Objects include machinery patterns, jute and flax products, small tools, technical drawings and plans and quality control/testing equipment. The archives and photographic records of various mills and their workers have considerable historical research value. As well as the large machinery objects, the collections cover the fields of industrial history, social history, fine art, archives/business papers, photographs, costume and numismatics. The Verdant Works was given Category A listed building status by Historic Scotland in 1987.</description>

            <description>The San Antonio Museum of Art (SAMA) is a museum in San Antonio, Texas. In the early 1970s, plans were initiated to purchase the historic Lone Star Brewery complex for conversion into the San Antonio Museum of Art and following a $7.2 million renovation, the San Antonio Museum of Art opened to the public in March 1981. The museum was funded through grants from the Economic Development Administration of San Antonio, and a numerous businessmen and foundations. File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Admiration (1897). jpg A William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) painting on display entitled Admiration (1897). When the museum opened it specialized in art of the Americas including pre-Columbian, Spanish Colonial and Latin American folk art. It also included eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth century American and European paintings, photography, sculpture and decorative arts. In 1985, the Museum received collections of Latin American Folk Art formed from former Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller and Robert K. Winn. In the 1990s the museum expanded considerably with donations from Gilbert M. Denman, Jr. , the addition of the Stark-Willson Collection which established a comprehensive collection of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art and a collection of Chinese ceramics from trustees Walter F. and Lenora Brown. The Chinese collection which also included other Asian objects resulted in a 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m) wing named after them, The Lenora and Walter F. Brown Asian Art Wing which opened in 2005 and is now the largest museum for Asian art in the southern United States. In 1991, the 7,000-square-foot (650 m) Cowden Gallery was opened for changing exhibitions and, in 1994, the 3,000-square-foot (280 m) Beretta Hops House was renovated to provide a new area for schooling with three main classrooms.

It is owned and managed by the Bath Preservation Trust. The museum includes a series of models, maps, paintings and reconstructions to show how a typical Georgian house was constructed, from the ashlar stone to the decorative plasterwork. Sections include displays of stone mining, furniture making, painting, wallpaper, soft furnishings and upholstery. A model of Bath on a 1:500 scale gives a bird's-eye view of the city. The study gallery specialises in books on architecture including the Bath Buildings Record and Coard Collection. The collection includes several works whose purchase was supported by the Art Fund. A panoramic view of Bath from Beechen Cliff, by Charles Joseph Hullmandel and dating from 1824 shows Bath as a still relatively small city, after its Georgian growth, but before the arrival of the railway and Victorian expansion. A slightly later panorama (1833) by Joseph William Allen (1803&amp;ndash;1852) is of Bath from Lyncombe Hill, on the present site of 6 Carlton Road, and includes a gabled house in the immediate centre foreground which still stands and is reputed to have been the house in which Alexander Pope once stayed.</description>

            <description>Battlefield House near King Street East and Centennial Parkway in Stoney Creek, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada is a living history museum and site of the historic Battle of Stoney Creek on June 6, 1813, which was fought during the War of 1812. It was built in 1796. The house and 15.5 acres of parkland (Battlefield Park), were the property of the Women's Wentworth Historical Society, (1899-1962), and given by this society to the Niagara Parks Commission as a National historical site on January 19, 1962. Nestled under the Niagara Escarpment, this historic site is located on 32 acres (12.9 ha) of park land linked to the Bruce Trail. British units made a night attack on an American encampment. Due in large part to the capture of both American brigadier generals, and an overestimation of British strength by the Americans, the battle was a victory for the British, and a turning point in the defence of Upper Canada.</description>

            <description>Rome Area History Museum, currently directed by Leigh Barba, was founded in 1996 to promote an understanding of the shared past, to enrich local lives, and to inspire a stronger sense of community. Since its establishment, the museum has received over 80,000 visitors. It is currently located in a former department store building at the corner of Third Avenue and Broad Street in downtown Rome, Georgia, United States. The museum strives to achieve its goals through preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting collections portraying the history of Rome and the surrounding area. It is a vital center for local historical research; and is open to the public Tuesday through Saturday. The permanent exhibits of the museum include: Native Americans in Floyd County; the founding of Rome; the local flood of 1886; and the local effects of wars. The Civil War exhibit contains a display of various rifles, swords, shots, shells, bullets, and uniform buckles. A Civil War hospital takes visitors back in time showing a surgeons kit that would have been used to tend to the wounded. On October 17, 2003, the museum opened a new permanent exhibit on the incredible life of native Roman, Admiral John H. Towers who is widely considered the Father of Naval Aviation. Other permanent exhibits display the development of Rome’s culture, life-ways, and industries.

The museum is built around the personal art collection of Heinrich Hirschsprung, a tobacco manufacturer and patron of the arts who founded his art collection in 1865. Almost four decades later, in 1902, he donated it to the Danish state. It is displayed in a purpose-built Neoclassical museum building designed by Hermann Baagøe Storck and completed in 1911.</description>

            <address>Singapore</address>
            <description>Baba House is a house, located at 157 Neil Road, in Singapore, showcasing Peranakan history, architecture and heritage. It is a traditional Peranakan pre-war terrace-house which formerly owned by 19th-century shipping tycoon Wee Bin who settled in Singapore, after arriving from the southern Chinese province of Fujian. The House is also an outpost of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Museum and co-managed by the NUS Centre for the Arts. Built possibly in the 1860s, 157 Neil Road is a residential terrace house located in the Residential Historic District of Blair Plain. The house and the surrounding area was gazetted for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore, in 1991. In April 2005, a S$4 million donation was made to the National University of Singapore (NUS) by Ms Agnes Tan, the last surviving daughter of the founder of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), the late Tun Tan Cheng Lock. This donation was given to the University to acquire Wee's traditional Peranakan house along Neil Road, built circa 1860 on the land plot bought by Wee Bin in 1860. The house is currently owned and managed by Mr Wee Lin, the sixth-generation descendant of Wee Bin. Another donation of S$1.5 million was made to the University, for acquisition of two other shophouses along Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock in Malacca. These acquired houses will be restored and used for educating younger generations about Peranakan history, culture and architecture, while the two houses in Malacca to be used for study on conservation techniques of historical buildings. In gesture of appreciation for the donation, the University named the Singapore house as the Tan Cheng Lock Baba House. The House was officially opened by President of Singapore Mr S R Nathan on September 4, 2008 as the Baba House, and opened to the public on September 15, 2008. Staff and students from NUS' School of Design and Architecture and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences' South-east Asia Studies Programme were involved in the restoration, which has elaborate and intricately carved wooden windows, doors and partition screens. About 70 per cent of the furniture in the House belonged to the Wee estate, while the rest of the items were acquired from Peranakan families in Singapore and Malacca. The first two storeys of the House showcase the Peranakan domestic interior, while artists showcase modern interpretations of Peranakan culture through the exhibition gallery on the third storey. At the same time, the House will also be a venue for Peranakan culinary and craft workshops to be organized by the NUS Museum. The Baba House served as a contrast to the Peranakan Museum wing of Asian Civilizations Museum, as the House enable visitors to experience more intimately how typical Peranakan homes looked and functioned in the 1920s, a time when there were big shifts in Peranakan family structures and their fortunes in Singapore. Its showcase of furniture and items encouraged visitors to interact and touch, and even book the venue to host events as part of the experience-making process. Because of the limited space and the fragility of Peranakan wares, visits to the House are limited to small groups of 12 and by appointments only, so as to reduce impacts made in the House.

            <description>Wolford Chapel is the burial place of John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. It is the property of Ontario, and flies the Flag of Canada despite being in the English countryside. The chapel was part of the Simcoe Estate near Honiton, Devon in South West England and was built on John Graves Simcoe's commission in 1802. Following Simcoe's death on October 26, 1806 the estate remained with the family, but was eventually sold and some parts broken up. The Chapel, alongside most of the estate, was acquired by British publisher Sir Geoffrey Harmsworth. Consideration of what to do with the chapel remained, and various ideas were but forward including transporting it to Canada. However, in 1966, Harmsworth decided to donate the chapel to the Ontario Heritage Trust. On September 27, 1966, just under 160 years after Simcoe's death, Harmsworth gave a deed to then-Premier of Ontario John Robarts, alongside a deed making a permanent right of way to access the property, presented by Mr A G LeMarchant. Simcoe's wife and children are also buried at the site, which is maintained by local people on behalf of the John Graves Simcoe Memorial Foundation.</description>

            <description>The Erland Lee Museum is a National Historic Site of Canada located on the ridge of the Niagara Escarpment in Stoney Creek, Ontario. Originally a farmhouse belonging to Erland and Janet Lee, the museum is recognized as the birthplace of the first Women's Institutes, an international organization formed in 1897 to promote the education of isolated rural women. The oldest part of the home, a log cabin, dates to 1808. An addition was built onto the log cabin in 1873 in the Carpenter Gothic style, part of the Gothic Revival Architectural tradition. This is best exemplified by the steeply-pitched gables, gingerbread trim, and the board-and-batten planks. The Lee Family lived in the house from 1808 until 1970, when it was sold to the Women's Institutes. Its first historical designation was granted in 1961, by the South Wentworth Women’s Institute. In 1972, the home was opened to the public as a museum, and has since been owned and operated by the Federated Women's Institutes of Ontario. In 1995, the museum was designated as a historic home under the Ontario Heritage Act, and in 2003, the museum was granted status as a National Historic Site of Canada. The museum itself contains three floors of original Victorian furniture and furnishings, with an emphasis on the history of the Lee family, and the events surrounding the 1897 founding of the Women's Institutes. For example, the dining room table on which Janet Lee wrote the first Women’s Institute constitution still stands in its original location. The farmhouse is complemented by an 1873 carriage house, which contains two floors of local history exhibits.</description>

The museum is founded in 1959 in Yakapınar village on the far east end of Adana at the west bank of Ceyhan river. File:Misis Mosaic Museum. jpeg At the museum various periods can be viewed in chronological order and floor mosaics belonging to a Basilica located within the boundaries of the Misis Ancient City is exhibited in situ. It was discovered in 1956 and the mosaic covered area was revealed by Theodor Bosset and Ludwig Budde from the German Archaeology Team who were carrying out excavations at that time at the Misis Mound. At the very centre of the composition there is a chicken coop built in the shape of a table or a side table surrounded by 23 birds or fowls taken by Noah onto his ship and behind this group there are various wild and domestic animals. It is from the 4th century. Misis Mosaic Museum has been enriched with the transfer of works which were taken to the Adana Archeological Museum after the Misis Mound excavations and the mosaics which were previously kept there, and by bringing together the dispersed architectural elements found around the Misis.</description>

            <name>Goldwell Open Air Museum</name>
            <address>near Rhyolite, Nevada</address>
            <description>The Goldwell Open Air Museum is an outdoor sculpture park near the ghost town of Rhyolite in the U.S. state of Nevada. The 7.8-acre (3.2 ha) site is located at the northern end of the Amargosa Valley, about 120 miles (190 km) northwest of Las Vegas, and about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Beatty off State Route 374. About 5 miles (8.0 km) further west is Death Valley National Park. In addition to the museum, the site includes the Red Barn Art Center, a 2,250-square-foot (209 m) multi-purpose studio and exhibition space used by artists-in-residence and other artists. Near the art center are the ruins of a jail and other buildings of the historic mining town of Bullfrog. The nonprofit museum was organized in 2000 after the death of Albert Szukalski, the Belgian artist who created the site's first sculptures in 1984 near the abandoned railway station in Rhyolite. The sculpture, The Last Supper, consists of ghostly life-sized forms arranged as in the painting The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci. Szukalski molded his shapes by draping plaster-soaked burlap over live models until the plaster dried enough to stand on its own. In the same year, using the same techniques, Szukalski also created Ghost Rider, a plaster figure preparing to mount a bicycle. Between then and 2007, other artists, including three other Belgians, added new works to the project. In 1989, Szukalski created Desert Flower, an assemblage of chrome car parts found in the desert. In the 1990s, Hugo Heyrman added Lady Desert: The Venus of Nevada, a cinder block sculpture in part based on the idea of the pixel. Fred Bervoets, in Tribute to Shorty Harris, celebrated one of the prospectors whose mining discovery of 1904 led to a gold rush. Dre Peters created Icara a hand-carved female version of Icarus, the boy in Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun. David Spicer fashioned Chained to the Earth out of rhyolite from a nearby quarry. Other works at the site include Sofie Siegmann's Sit Here!, a couch created in 2000 for the Lied Discovery Children's Museum in Las Vegas and restored and moved to Goldwell in 2007. In 2006, Eames Demetrios added a plaque, Rhyolite's District of Shadows. The museum is a member of Alliance of Artists Communities. In 2008, the New York State Artist Workspace Consortium selected it for a mentorship project. The Red Barn is the site of an arts festival, Albert's Tarantella, held each year in October.</description>

            <description>The National Museum of Aleppo is the largest museum in the city of Aleppo, founded in 1931. It is located in the heart of the northern city on Baron Street, adjacent to the famous Baron Hotel, near Bab al-Faraj clock tower. In 1931, under the decision of the Syrian authorities, a small Ottoman palace was designated to become the National Museum in the city of Aleppo. After three decades of developments, the building has become too small to host the growing number of the exhibited items. As a result, a decision was made in 1966, to demolish the old building of the museum and replace it with a large modern structure. All historical periods are exhibited in the museum, however the greatest emphasis is put on the Iron Age, while there is a quite big Islamic section. The entrance is a temple gateway with a female sphinx from the Iron Age (9th century B.C. ) Neo-Hittite settlement of Tell Halaf. Aleppo Museum is unique among other museums for the fact that all exhibited items are of Syrian origin.</description>

            <description>Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in the Drake Circus area of Plymouth, Devon, England is the largest museum and art gallery in the city. It was built in 1907-10 by Thornely and Rooke in Edwardian Baroque style. Its interior was restored in 1954 after being gutted in The Blitz. The Museum has collections of fine and decorative arts, natural history and human history. The museum's natural history collection consists of over 150,000 specimens and an historic natural history library and archive. Many prehistoric artefacts from Dartmoor, important Bronze Age and Iron Age material from Mount Batten and medieval and post-medieval finds from Plymouth are found in the human history collection alongside artifacts from Ancient Egypt and other ancient cultures of Europe and the Middle East. The Art Gallery collections include 750 easel paintings, over 3,000 watercolours and drawings, at least 5,000 prints and a sizeable collection of sculptures. A large proportion of the art was donated to the people of Plymouth in 1852 by William Cotton (1795–1863) and is known as the Cottonian Collection. It had been put together principally by the collector Charles Rogers (1711–1784), and includes works by Sir Joshua Reynolds who was born locally. The gallery also includes items by local artist Robert Lenkiewicz and work by artists of the 19th century Newlyn School, the influential 20th century St. Ives group of painters, and the Camden Town Group. Other artists represented are Edgar Degas, Edward Burne-Jones, John William Waterhouse, Claude Lorrain, Terry Frost, J M W Turner, John Brett, John Everett Millais, Benjamin Robert Haydon and Samuel Prout. The latter two painters were born locally. Four new galleries were opened as part of a refurbishment project in early 2009. The renovated ground floor galleries were formally opened by HRH Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh on 25 May 2009. He is Patron of the Friends of Plymouth City Museums &amp;amp; Gallery, which was founded in 1951.</description>

            <description>The McNay Art Museum, founded in 1950 in San Antonio, is the first modern art museum in the State of Texas. The museum was created by Marion Koogler McNay's original bequest of most of her fortune, her important art collection and her 24-room Spanish Colonial Revival-style mansion that sits on 23 acres that are landscaped with fountains, broad lawns and a Japanese-inspired garden and fishpond. Mrs. McNay (7 February 1883 – 13 April 1950) was an American painter and art teacher who inherited a substantial oil fortune upon the death of her father. The museum was named after her, and has been expanded to include galleries of medieval and Renaissance artwork and a larger collection of 20th-century European and American modernist work. The museum focuses primarily on 19th and 20th century European and American art by such artists as Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, Georgia O’Keeffe, Diego Rivera, Mary Cassatt, and Edward Hopper. The collection today consists of over 14,000 objects and is one of the finest collections of Contemporary Art and Sculpture in the Southwestern United States. The museum also is home to the Tobin Collection of Theater Arts, which is one of the premiere collections of its kind in the U.S. , and a research library with over 30,000 volumes. More recently, the McNay Art Museum recently added the Stieren Center, built by internationally renown architect Jean-Paul Viguier, to display their Modern collection.</description>

            <address>Bolshaya Sadovaya ulitsa no. 10, apartament №50. Moscow, Russia</address>
            <description>The Bulgakov Museum in Moscow commemorates the life and work of author Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov in an apartment where he lived, and which he set portions of his famous novel The Master and Margarita. Graffiti, including text from the novel and drawings of its characters, have decorated the external walls and stairwells of the apartment building since the beginning of perestroika. It is located about two blocks from Patriarshiye Ponds, the scene of the opening chapter of the novel, where the Moscow city government had planned to erected statues commemorating the novel. The once luxurious rental house, constructed by millionaire Ilya Pigit, owner of the tobacco factory Ducat, was fitted for the first working commune after the revolution. The house, which housed or was visited by dancer Isadora Duncan and poet Sergey Esenin, Alice Koonen and Andrei Bely, Vasily Surikov and tenor Fedor Shalyapin, imaginists and futurists, the members of the artistic group the Jack of Diamonds, and the whole Moscow bohemians, was filled up with the proletariat in the early post-revolutionary years. The studios of the artists Pyotr Konchalovsky and Georgy Yakulov, which were situated in the court of the house 10, were kept, and artistic life continued to pulsate there weakly. What occurred in other apartments – Bulgakov described vividly in the stories № 13 – Elpit Rabcommune Building, The Psalm, The Moonshine Lake, and finally in the novel The Master and Margarita. The communal flat № 50, where Mikhail Bulgakov and his wife lived in 1921 – 1924, became the prototype of that Odd Flat, where Voland with his court settled up, and where that leading to another measurement mysterious stairs is situated. Years passed, and the stairs of the entrance № 6 became a bewitched place: since 1970s people come here to sit on those steps, where Annushka found the horse-shoe, to recollect the favourite fragments from the Novel, to sing and to dream. The stairs became one of the unofficial cultural centers of Moscow of 1980-90s. In the attic the “Academy of the Hippie” was organized, and the walls of the entrance were covered with drawings, quotations from Bulgakov’s works, declarations of love to Bulgakov and his characters. All these years the door of the flat № 50 was closed for the fans of Bulgakov: it housed a design office. But in the 1990s the Bulgakov Fund was based there, and then since April 2007 – the only official in Russia Bulgakov Museum. File:Cat Begemoth. jpg Cat Behemoth. Now The Odd Flat revived and not only shadows of literary personages and former tenants roam here. It is opened for everyone, who wants to find himself inside the Novel, to learn more about Bulgakov and his epoch, to communicate with like-minded persons. Gradually a constant exposition was created on the base of the collections of Bulgakov’s nieces E.A. Zemskaya and V.M. Svetlaeva, and also V.F. Dimenko’s collection. Cultural events in “The Odd Flat”: plays of the theatre KomediantЪ, the first half of 20th century jazz concerts and concerts of classical music, exhibitions and subject seminars: culturological seminars are connected with the club New Moscow, literary-philosophical – with the work of the Bulgakov discussion club, and traditional meetings of Aleksey Didurov’s Rock-cabaret.</description>

            <description>Prescott House is a historic house located in Starr's Point, Nova Scotia which is part of the Nova Scotia Museum. Built between 1812 and 1816 by Charles Ramage Prescott as the centrepiece of his country estate called &quot;Acacia Grove&quot;, it is one of the best preserved Georgian houses in Atlantic Canada. Prescott, a wealthy merchant from Halifax, Nova Scotia purchased the land in 1811 when he took early retirement from his shipping and trading career. He used Acacia Grove as a base for agricultural experiments, importing a wide variety of plants, especially apple varieties which he shared freely with area growers. When Prescott died in 1859, the house was purchased and maintained for several decades by the Kaye family. However later owners neglected the house and by the 1890s, it fell into ruin. In 1931 the house was purchased by Mary Allison Prescott, the great granddaughter of Charles Prescott. She restored the house and lived in it with her two sisters until 1970. They donated the house to the Province of Nova Scotia in 1971. The house is operated as part of the Nova Scotia Museum system and explores Prescott's life, Georgian architecture, the apple industry and the lives of the Prescott sisters. Fully restored rooms depict both the Georgian period of Charles Prescott's time and the later era of the 1930s and 40s when it was restored by the Prescott sisters. Open from May to October, the museum offers guided tours of the period rooms and hosts a variety of regular events to interpret the house and its gardens for families and children. The house is a Canadian National Historic Site as well as a provincial heritage building.</description>

On January 1, 2006 the Museum, known then as ACM 1 closed the Armenian Street wing for a major revamp. At its closure, the museum management chose Peranakan culture theme over a children's museum and a Chinese ceramic museum as their new showcase in the Tao Nan School space. This enabled the Museum to house the world's most distinctive and comprehensive Peranakan museum collection of artifacts and wares, with a potential annual visitorship numbers of 112,000 people. Also, the revamp enabled 25 per cent more exhibition space for contextual displays for different aspects of Peranakan home and lifestyle. It also includes plans for Peranakan-themed eateries and shops in the row of four shophouses adjacent to its building. The museum officially opened on April 25, 2008, with ten permanent galleries showcasing main themes of Peranakan life. A central feature of the museum is the Peranakan Wedding Bed which once belonged to Mrs. Quah Hong Chiam of Penang, and the very bed where she gave birth to the first seven of her 11 children. The different galleries are found in the following manner: Gallery 1 (Level 1) Galleries 2 – 5 (Level 2) Galleries 6 - 10 (Level 3) Special Exhibitions Galleries (Level 3) Peranakan Museum's central piece of display, the Peranakan Wedding Bed.

            <description>The Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille (Lille Palace of Fine Arts) is one of the largest museums in France, and the largest French museum outside of Paris. It was one of the first museums built in France, established under the instructions of Napoleon I at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the popularisation of art : The Chaptal decree of 1801 selects fifteen French cities (among which Lille) to receive the works seized from churches and from the territories occupied by the armies of Revolutionary France. The painters Louis Joseph Watteau and François Watteau, known as the &quot;Watteau of Lille&quot;, were heavily involved in the museum's beginnings - Louis Joseph Watteau made in 1795 the first inventory of the paintings confiscated during the Revolution, whilst his son François was deputy curator of the museum from 1808 to 1823. The museum opened in 1809 and was initially housed in a church confiscated from the Récollets before being transferred to the city's town hall. In 1866 the &quot;musée Wicar&quot; (formed from the collection of Jean-Baptiste Wicar) was merged into the Palais des Beaux-Arts. Construction of the Palais's current Belle Époque-style building began in 1885 under the direction of Géry Legrand, mayor of Lille, and it was completed in 1892. The architects chosen to design the new building were Bérard and Delmas from Paris. The building is located on the place de la République, in the center of the city, facing the préfecture of Lille. It was renovated during the 90s and reopened in 1997. At the start of the 1990s the building's poor state and the moving of Vauban's relief models of fortified towns to Lille forced the town to renovate the building. Work began in 1991, under the architects Jean-Marc Ibos and Myrto Vitart, and was completed in 1997. This allowed the creation of a new 700 m² basement room for temporary exhibitions, as well as departments for the relief models and for 19th-century sculpture. Overall the museum covers 22000 m², the second largest collection in France after the Louvre. Its sculptures, paintings, drawings, ceramics and so on include works by Raphael, Donatello, Van Dyck, Tissot, Jordaens, Rembrandt, Goya, El Greco, David, Corot, Courbet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix, Rubens, Rodin, Claudel and Jean-Baptiste Chardin.</description>

            <description>The Farina fragrance museum is situated across from the town-hall, and near the famous Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in the Obenmarspforten street in Cologne. Founded in 1709, John Maria Farina opposite the Jülichs Place is the eldest fragrance factory still standing and has house the registered office since 1723. The museum provides over several floors a very detailed insight into the production methods of perfume throughout the various stages. The focus is primarily laid on Eau de Cologne, and you will therefore discover some particular technical devices such as distillation apparatus which were once used. In addition to the equipment, you will also be able to witness the evolution thanks to various pictures and documents which help trace back history. Moreover, as copyright didn’t exist in those days, a great deal of imitations and forgeries of Eau de Cologne rapidly appeared on the market and a certain number of them are also presented in the museum. Further details as to the changes in the manufacturing of Farina Eau de Cologne are also on display. On 25 November 2006, in commemoration of John Maria Farina’s 240th death anniversary, the Farina House was elected “place to be” within the context of the project “Germany Land to be”. .</description>

            <description>Desert Christ Park is a 3.5-acre (14,000 m) sculpture garden in Yucca Valley, California. The park was sculpted and created by Antone Martin, a former aircraft worker who died in 1961 at the age of 74. Martin started sculpting the figures during the height of the Cold War atomic bomb scare of the mid-1940s, hoping that the sculptures would inspire global peace. Sculptures include The Twelve Apostles, Martha, Mary, angels, and a 15-foot-tall, 3 ton statue of Jesus, reminiscent of Rio de Janeiro's famous and much larger hilltop Christ the Redeemer. The park was neglected between 1988 and 1996, while the ACLU sued San Bernardino County for separation of church and state issues, after which a nonprofit foundation took over and renovated the park.</description>

Type Inuit artWebsite www. miamuseum. ca The Museum of Inuit Art, located within the historic Queens Quay Terminal at Toronto’s Harbourfront Centre, is Canada’s only public museum south of the Arctic to be devoted exclusively to Inuit art and culture. Officially launched in June 2007, the museum exists due to the efforts of David Harris — a former teacher in Nunavut and founder of The Harris Inuit Gallery, a respected commercial gallery for Inuit art — and a group of dedicated partners. The Museum of Inuit Art occupies more than 6,000 square feet (560 m) of exhibition space and is home to hundreds of extraordinary pieces of Inuit art ranging from sculptures carved from stone, antler, ivory and bone to ceramics, prints and wall hangings. The space housing the Museum of Inuit Art was designed by gh3 inc. and has won two design awards: the Ontario Association of Architects Design Excellence Award, and the Canada Interiors’ Best of Canada Design Competition Award. “The interior of the museum has been designed to remove visitors from the commercial clutter of the adjacent downtown shopping arcade and transport them to a more rarefied environment for viewing art — a neutral white shell evoking the iconic landscape forms of the arctic ice. ”</description>

            <address>116 Blue Star San Antonio, Texas,</address>
            <description>The Blue Star Contemporary Art Center (BSCAC) is the acting contemporary art museum of San Antonio. Known simply as Blue Star, it was established as a grassroots response to the cancellation of a contemporary arts exhibit at the San Antonio Museum of Art in 1985. The effort established a vibrant venue for the exhibition of contemporary art in San Antonio. The center is housed in an adapted 1920's era warehouse facility located on the banks of the San Antonio River. The organization, which was originally operated by artists and volunteers, was formally organized with a professional director and staff in 1988 and is now run by director Bill FitzGibbons. Today the center is a primary destination for new art in South Texas and the center has over 20 exhibitions each year that has showcased local and international artists such as Hiroshi Sugimoto, Ryan McGinness, Zane Lewis, Mike Bidlo, Oliver Herring, Chuck Ramirez, Sky Patterson, Julia Landois, John Mata, Kimberly Aubuchon, Vincent Valdez, Alex Rubio, Thomas Cummins, Linda Pace, Ed Saavedra, James Surls,Larry Leisner, Dayna De Hoyos, Jason Willome, Ron Binks, Justin Parr, Chris Sauter, Richie Budd, and Dario Robleto. In 2006, George Yepes had a show opening that was attended by film directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The facility in which the center is housed is now referred to as the Blue Star Complex and has been redeveloped as an arts-oriented mixed-use development that includes loft/studio apartments, galleries, retail, performance spaces, artists' work spaces, and design offices. Blue Star is widely recognized as the catalyst for the revitalization of the South Alamo neighborhoods that surround the facility. Like many other cities, San Antonio has First Friday art openings where Blue Star essentially acts as the hub of the downtown art walk on the first Friday of every month. In addition, Blue Star is credited with the City of San Antonio's establishment of Contemporary Art Month held annually in July at over 70 venues throughout the city.</description>

            <description>The New Jersey State Museum is located at 205 West State Street in Trenton, New Jersey, United States, overlooking the Delaware River. The Museum is operated as part of the New Jersey Department of State. General admission is free. The Museum's main collection of artifacts and fine art dates back to items collected in the early 19th century. The Museum also includes a 150-seat planetarium and a 380-seat auditorium. The Museum's replica of a Hadrosaurus — a specimen unearthed in Haddonfield in 1858 that was selected as the state's official dinosaur in 1991 — was the target of a renovation project in the late 1990s to correct a display that had been on exhibit since the 1930s. The replica's original skull, a model created as a substitute because the actual skull was not preserved, was to be replaced with the narrower skull of another duck-billed dinosaur. The New Jersey State Museum serves a broad region between New York and Philadelphia. Because the Museum’s general admission is free and all programs are free or offered at a very low-cost, the Museum is accessible to visitors with low- to moderate incomes.</description>

In 2000 the museum was renamed President Nuñez museum under the presidency of his successor, Joan Gaspart. On 15 June 2010 the museum was reopened after a long restructuring. The restructuring saw the museum split in three separate sections with a 3D cinema, audiovisual touch-screen, and information on the history of FC Barcelona. The first section includes a collection of photos, documents and trophies detailing the club's history on an interactive glass wall, allowing visitors to touch the screens and see information wall. The glass wall, equipped with laser technology, allows the exhibition of video, images and music through user-feedback. The second section is a private art collection on permanent display at the museum which exhibits works by local artists as Dalí, Miró and Tàpies. In the third section is the Futbolart Collection displays various football memorabilia from throughout the history of the club including a trophy-room with every trophy, or a replica thereof, that the club has ever won. One of the items at display in the Futbolart Collection is the boots with which Ronald Koeman scored the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup Final, which he did in the 111th minute against Sampdoria, 21 minutes into extra time, securing Barcelona's first European trophy. The museum occupies 3,500 square meters and attracts 1.2 million visitors a year, ranking it second to the Museu Picasso, which attracts 1.3 million visitors, as the most visited museum in the city of Barcelona.</description>

            <description>The Kamakura Museum of Literature is a small museum in Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan, that contains material about writers who have lived, died, or were active in the city of Kamakura itself. The museum displays personal effects, manuscripts, first editions, and documents owned by well over a hundred writers of Japanese literature, including Soseki Natsume and Kawabata Yasunari, as well as film director Yasujiro Ozu. The villa that hosts the museum, its large garden and its rose garden are also of great interest. The plaque in front of the villa says: Kamakura Museum of Literature (a villa of the old, noble Maeda family) The house was erected in 1936 by Toshinari Maeda (前田利為), the 16th head of the Maeda family, (part of the Kaga clan). It stands half way up a hill in Kamakura, overlooking Sagami Bay. It represents the villa architecture of those days. Eisaku Sato, a former Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner, once made use of it as his villa. It also appeared in a scene from &quot;Spring Snow&quot;, a novel by Yukio Mishima, a well-known novelist. It opened to the public as Kamakura Museum of Literature in November 1985. The Main Building of the Kamakura Museum of Literature was registered as a National Registered Tangible Property in April 2000.</description>

In 2001, the center opened a $3.3 million, two-story brick and glass headquarters. &quot;It's a first-rate collection,&quot; said William A. Link, chairman of the history department at the University of Florida, &quot;Sometimes you get collections that have been sanitized. That's not the case with this collection. It's quite full and rich. &quot; The Helms Center also hosts a center-sponsored lecture series with notable participants such as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Condoleezza Rice and the Dalai Lama.

            <name>Texas Trail Museum</name>
            <address>201 West 3rd Street</address>
            <description>The Texas Trail Museum was formed in 1986 by a small group of dedicated individuals, in a building which was then the Power Plant/Fire House for the Town of Pine Bluffs. It is located at the corner of 3rd and Market Streets, next to a row of majestic pines, which shade a large picnic area and a historic marker for the Texas Cattle Trail. When first formed, needing a place to display artifacts, the Board negotiated with the Town of Pine Bluffs during the weeks leading up to the Town's centennial. On September 16, 1986, by Resolution 86-16, signed by Timothy T. Connor, Mayor and Dema Jo Gilbert, Clerk, the Town leased to the Texas Trail Museum: &quot;... a non-profit organization in the state of Wyoming, a building known as the 'Old Power Plant,' situated on the northwest corner of Market Street and Third Street in the Town of Pine Bluffs, Wyoming for the sum of one dollar ($1.00) per year. &quot; Begun with only a few women's furs, dresses and hats, exhibits have since expanded to fill the building and then some. Today the museum is a 4-1/2 acre complex, which includes: the Main Exhibition Hall, the Agriculture and Transportation Building – made possible by the generosity of Curtis and Helen Bowser of Boulder City, NV. The Bowser family was an early homestead family near Hillsdale, the de-commissioned Saint Mary's Catholic Church, the Muddy Creek School (the first one-room school house in southeastern Laramie County), the Bowser Homestead Cottage (a classic example of how early homesteaders lived), the Union Pacific Railroad is well-represented, with a caboose, a switchman's shack and a telegraph shed, the Brodine-Walker Boarding House, which had been run by local families who rented rooms to U.P. crewmen between assignments. U.S. Route 30 (Lincoln Highway), the first completed paved highway linking Boston with San Francisco, runs along the north side of the museum property. Established by a small group of dedicated individuals in 1986, the museum's mission is to preserve and restore the heritage of the Frontier crossroads area (Eastern Laramie County, Wyoming) for future generations, through displays and education. Open from Memorial Day through Labor day, Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. , the Museum is located on the corner of 3rd and Market Streets in downtown Pine Bluffs, Wyoming. The Texas Trail Museum houses the generators used to supply electricity to Pine Bluffs around the middle of the 20th century. The museum complex displays artifacts of the 1800 and 1900s. A 1938 fire engine formerly used by the Town of Pine Bluffs, is displayed at the Texas Trail Museum. Twin diesel engines that provided electricity for Pine Bluffs from 1937–1960, are displayed at the Texas Trail Museum. Donated to the Museum in 2007, by Dr. Charles (Chuck) Reher and the Archeology Department at the U. of Wyoming, this teepee is a perfect example of the type used by American Indians who inhabited the area around Pine Bluffs a century ago. Many teepee rings have been discovered in the Bluffs south of town. The first schoolhouse in southeastern Laramie County and a restored former Catholic Church are located at the Texas Trail Museum. The interior of the first schoolhouse built in southeastern Laramie County is displayed at the Texas Trail Museum. A covered wagon, saddles, bridles, and other old west necessities are on display at the Texas Trail Museum The Brodine-Walker Boarding House, which was built in the early 1900s, housed many railroad workers and travelers. A Union Pacific Caboose is available at the museum for touring.</description>

            <description>Alexander I Palace in Taganrog is a one-storey stone building in Russian classicism style on Grecheskaya Street, 40 where Russian emperor Alexander I of Russia died in 1825. The mansion was built in 1806 and belonged to different owners. The most significant of them was the Governor of Taganrog Pyotr Papkov. Emperor Alexander I of Russia stayed there twice – in 1818 and 1825. After his death the building was bought by his widow empress consort Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)‎ and the first memorial museum in Russia dedicated to the late Emperor was established there. Among the visitors to the palace of Alexander I were the Russian emperors Alexander II of Russia and Alexander III, poets Alexander Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky, artist Ivan Aivazovsky, People’s commissar of enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky, and many others. For 12 years since 1864 an amateur choir conducted by Pavel Chekhov sang in the Church of Exaltation of the Cross, which was established within the mansion to honor the emperor. At the end of 1860s – beginning of 1870s Alexander, Nicolas and Anton Chekhov sang there in choral parts of descant and alto. In 1928 the memorial museum was closed and some of the exhibits were moved into the Alferaki Palace. Today the building of the Palace of Alexander I houses a children’s sanatorium called “Beryozka”.</description>

            <address>East Point, Northern Territory</address>
            <description>The Darwin Military Museum was originally established as an artillery museum by the Royal Australian Artillery Association (NT) Inc (RAAA) to exhibit photographs and artefacts from Darwin's history during World War II. The Museum now has a large exhibits of items from the war, including Navy, Army and Air Force items from Australian, US and other armed forces. Its setting is, appropriately, amongst concrete gun emplacements and other fortifications in an area that was one of the most heavily fortified parts of Australia during the war. At the peak in around 1943, there were over 110 000 armed forces personnel based in Darwin and nearby areas. It was from Darwin that General Douglas MacArthur launched his campaign to liberate Manila and more generally to reclaim the Philippines from Japanese occupation. During the war Darwin was bombed 64 times over almost two years, with the first two raids alone on 19 February 1942 resulting in the deaths of an estimated 243 people. Other sources place the figure as much higher, even up to 1000, and a memorial plaque on the Darwin Esplanade overlooking the harbour says 292 people were killed. ABC TV News on 28 February 2010 carried an item saying that Darwin City Council has commissioned Naval Historian John Bradford to get to the truth on how many died.

            <description>John Bunyan Museum is a museum primarily dedicated to the life, times and works of John Bunyan. The museum is located in Bedford, Bedfordshire, England. John Bunyan (1628 &amp;ndash; 1688), a Christian writer and preacher, was born in Harrowden (one mile south-east of Bedford), in the Parish of Elstow, England. He wrote The Pilgrim's Progress, arguably the most famous published Christian allegory. In the Church of England he is remembered with a Lesser Festival on 30 August. In 1672, the congregation led by Bunyan purchased a barn which they used to conduct worship. Eventually, a church, which came to be called the Bunyan Meeting Free Church, was built on the site of the barn. In 1849, a second church was built which is still used for services. A separate museum building was constructed on the compound in 1998 and the Bunyan artifacts and memorabilia formerly housed in a small museum room in the church moved into it. The museum has a number of recreation scenes from Bunyan's life which also show some of Bedford's social history in the 17th century. In addition there are artifacts such as Bunyan's iron violin and wooden flute, Bunyan's stoneware jug he used in prison as well as his will and a third edition of The Pilgrim's Progress.</description>

            <description>The Museum of Papermaking in Duszniki-Zdrój – a museum of the Lower Silesia Voivodeship Selfgovernment located in Duszniki-Zdrój in Poland, founded in 1968 in an old 17th century paper mill on the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river. The paper mill is one of the most architecturally valuable industrial monuments in Europe. It is characteristic for its shingle roofing trimmed with a baroque volute from the west and the original entrance pavilion and inside the building – the 17-19th century wall paintings. The tradition of papermaking in Duszniki dates back to the 16th century; the first record about the paper mill comes from 1562, and tells about the sale of his shares in the moulding room by Ambrosius Tepper to Nicolas Kretschmer. The original paper mill was destroyed in the flood in 1601. The mill was rebuilt and making of paper was resumed in 1605. The Museum was opened for visitors on July 26, 1968 and three years later paper production by hand was launched on show. The moulding room soon became an attraction drawing tens of thousands of tourists every year. The flood of 1998 inflicted a great damage on the paper mill. Water washed the foundations of the drying room and deposited tons of mud and debris inside the building. The damage was repaired thanks to the financial assistance from the Polish government. In 2007-2008 due to extensive alterations, the Museum was adapted to the needs of disabled visitors. Since 2001 the Museum has been organizer of „Święto Papieru” (The Holiday of Paper) – a kind of feast which promotes the knowledge and importance of paper, print, bookbinding and contemporary art. The Museum displays mainly exhibitions on the history of paper.</description>

            <description>Fort Amiel Museum is in Newcastle KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Fort Amiel was constructed in 1876 by Major Charles Frederick Amiel and soldiers of the 80th Staffordshire Volunteers. It was built as a fort and &quot;look-out post&quot;, for the British during the run up to the annexation of the former Transvaal and the Zulu War, although it really never served that purpose. During the First Boer War it was used as a garrison for the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster). Fort Amiel served as a commissariat depot, transit camp and hospital. Many wounded soldiers were taken there, to recover from their wounds. The fort is positioned on a knoll overlooking the original wagon drift across the Ncandu River. It has majestic views of the Drakensburg mountain range and the town of Newcastle. Major Charles Frederick Amiel was born on 2 August 1822, in Hanover Square, London, England. He was christened on 2 August 1822 in St Peter, Chertsey, Surrey, England. Major Amiel died on 10 September 1885 at London, England. He was buried at St Peter, Westminster, London. Amiel never married. The fort and surroundings,including a graveyard below the knoll fell into disuse for many years. In 1979 the site was declared a National Monument and restoration work began after the discovery of the original plans for the fort were discovered during this period in a London Museum. The restoration work was undertaken by the visionary Newcastle Town Council and in conjunction with the Natal Museum Services. Today,Fort Amiel houses an historic/cultural museum. Military displays of the two Anglo-Boer Wars. There is a wonderful cookhouse re-construction, this shows a typical British Army Base found in the 1880s. An addition to the fort and museum is a Zulu Umuzi(Hut) with a detailed interior.</description>
