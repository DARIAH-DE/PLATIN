            <description>Rino Ferrario was an Italian football (soccer) player. He was one of five players selected to the Italian national team for the 1954 World Cup that did not see any action. Nicknamed 'mobilia' for his rugby player-like physique (he was one of the biggest players ever on the national team to that point), Ferrario in defensive midfield was impossible to knock down, difficult to get by. With these talents he became a starter at Juventus winning the position from Carlo Parola.</description>
